Zone of Comfort
Chapter 1
Introduction to Azael and Anathema, the guild and some problems that they will have to deal with.
Azael just wants to be left alone and have her beer discount, Anathema just wants to drink tea with Mirtha and make Azael happy.
But things happen. With the new trials, Azael must face again the possibility of being found out, so she will have to chose between her peace and her beer discount.

The lanterns from the festival still clung to the streets in strips of bruised colour, paper animals sagging from strings, wax pooling on cobbles. Children's songs had followed them out of the square, thin and sharp, then died behind closed shutters. Painted faces, sugar swans, prizes for chasing ribbons—but the burnt caramel taste wouldn't leave Azael's mouth.
Bia's arms looped round her neck. The girl's cheek pressed into Azael's shoulder blade, hot through the fabric. Each breath hitched, held, spilled in small sobs that Bia strangled back, like the noise itself shamed her.
Azael carried her without shifting her grip. Her sunglasses sat pushed up on her head; the evening air cooled the skin above her black flame-and-claw tattoos. She kept her eyes forward, reading the town by the hard edges of buildings and the thick glow of people's mana like stains on glass.
Anathema walked at her side, each step landing with a weight that made grit jump. The lamplight caught on his bark in patches, and the roots that curled out of his sockets twitched as if tasting the air. Tomé held both his hands, small fingers wrapped around wood that felt like warm fence posts left in sun.
Tomé's nose shone. His mouth stayed tight, like one slip would crack him open.
Azael's shoulders rose once.
"You breathe like you swallowed a nail," Bia muttered into her.
Azael kept her pace.
"Yeah. It's fashionable."
Bia's fingers clenched in Azael's shirt, then loosened. Another quiet shake ran through her. No more words came, only that stubborn, swallowed sound.
They passed the fountain where the festival organisers had dumped wilting garlands. Someone had knocked over a bucket of glitter; it lay in a drift on the ground like frost. Azael's boots scuffed through it, and it clung to the leather.
Tomé's gaze stuck on the silver smear on Azael's heel, then lifted to the empty street ahead.
The closer they got to the centre, the more the air changed. Voices piled up, angry and excited, a wave of noise rolling between the buildings. A cluster of people jammed the cross street, shoulders pressed tight, heads craning. A child's squeal cut through—not the playful kind. Something thudded. Someone laughed too loudly.
Azael's jaw set. Her hand tightened under Bia's thigh.
Tomé leaned towards the sound, his grip on Anathema's hands pulling him half a step.
"I wonder what happened there."
Anathema's head angled, roots fanning. His feet paused. The ground carried the tremor of too many bodies shifting at once.
"You may observe." Each word came out slow, careful, placed like a brick. His hands stayed open for Tomé, patient as a gate.
Tomé looked at the crowd, then at Bia's tangled hair against Azael's shoulder. He shook his head, hard enough to make his cheeks wobble.
"No. I'm tired. And Bia needs… we need to get her home."
Anathema's weight settled back into motion. The four of them skirted the noise. Azael kept her eyes ahead, refused to let the glow of the gathering hook her attention. Whatever it was, it could wait. Her arms ached, her spine complained, and Bia's heartbreak sat on her back like a sack of stones.
Bia's street smelled of laundry water and onion peels. Light spilled from one window, warm and yellow. The door opened before Azael knocked.
Elena filled the doorway with rolled sleeves and flour on her forearms, her hair pinned up in a hurry. Her gaze snapped from Azael to Bia's face.
Bia slid down, feet hitting the step. Her lip trembled. She turned and bolted inside, shoulders hunched, a small storm disappearing into the house.
Elena's breath left her. She rubbed her brow with the heel of her hand.
"So." Her eyes flicked to Azael. "What did that boy do?"
Azael stood with her hands empty, fingers still shaped from carrying.
"He kissed someone else. Right in front of her. Festival game. 'Dare' whatever. Kids thought it was funny."
Elena's mouth tightened, then softened into a tired line. She looked past Azael's shoulder to where Tomé hovered by Anathema's knee.
Tomé stared at the step, cheeks red, like he'd absorbed blame through proximity.
Elena's shoulders slumped.
"Thank you for bringing her." She shifted her focus to Tomé, her voice gentler. "And you too. You did good."
Tomé's fingers twisted around each other.
"She looked like she got… cracked."
Elena's hand reached out and rested on Tomé's shoulder, solid, warm.
"Be patient with her. Bia's strong. Nothing will break her."
Tomé swallowed. His eyes stayed wet.
"Okay." He nodded once, then frowned at his own chest. "Why do I feel sad too?"
Elena's thumb pressed once into his shoulder. She stepped back into the house, leaving the door ajar.
Azael turned them away before Tomé could stand there and listen to Bia cry through the walls.
The bakery sat at the end of the lane, its windows fogged from heat. The smell hit first—yeast, sugar, cinnamon—and it wrapped round Tomé's face like a blanket. Anathema ducked slightly to avoid the hanging sign. The wood of him caught the glow from inside and turned amber at the edges.
Mirtha stood behind the counter with her sleeves rolled high, thick arms dusted in flour like snow. She took one look at Tomé's expression and clicked her tongue.
"Oh, look at you." She scooped him close with one arm, pressing his cheek into her apron without asking. Her other hand pointed at Azael. "What'd you lot do, start a war at a kiddie party?"
Azael leaned her hip against the doorframe.
"Kid stuff. The kind that feels like knives when you're ten."
Mirtha pulled back enough to look at Tomé's face, then at Azael's.
"Tell me."
Azael laid it out plain, no decoration, like setting bread on a table.
Mirtha's mouth lifted, then dropped, her eyes creasing.
"Ay." She chuckled, and the sound carried a bruise. "The first heartbreak. They grow so fast."

The tower clung to the bakery like an afterthought, old stone patched with moss. Azael's rent came cheap because the stairs groaned and the windows sat crooked in their frames. It smelled like woods and grass after rain—earth and green things left to rot soft.
She dropped onto the couch and pressed her face into the cushions.
"Being human is hard."
The words slipped out before she could catch them. Pretending to be human, anyway. The lie sat easier on her tongue these days. Years of practice, years of mimicking what she'd only observed from the outside.
Anathema lowered himself to the floor at her feet, settling his weight with a creak. His roots curled against the worn rug.
"I got angry at that kid." His voice came slow, deliberate. "But it's not his fault. I wonder why I'm still angry."
Azael pressed her fingers into her temples, small circles that did nothing for the pressure building there. The headaches had teeth now. Sharp ones.
"Because you care about her. Nobody likes seeing who they care about suffer." She dropped her hands. "It's fine to be mad."
Even when caring feels borrowed. Even when you learned it secondhand from someone who isn't here anymore.
"Are you mad?"
"I'm sad."
Anathema's bark shifted, a sound like settling wood.
"Ah… yeah. I'm too."
He rose, joints clicking faintly.
"I'm going to find some flower or weird crystalized animal for her. She likes when I bring those."
Azael's mouth lifted.
"Go. But be careful. Dolls aren't supposed to be that independent."
"Correct. I won't take long."
The door shut behind him. Azael waited until his footsteps faded—until the faint tug in her chest confirmed the distance growing between them—then dragged herself upright.
The bath ran hot enough to pink her skin. She sank into it and let the water work at the knots in her shoulders. The headaches had been crawling up her skull for weeks now, and the nightmares followed like rot. Something heavy sat in her chest, shapeless and waiting. All she could do was let it grow. All she ever did was wait. For the goddess to return. For the divine hands that shaped Anathema to reach down again. For answers that never came.
Tomorrow meant quests. Two every fifteen days to keep her Adventurer registration active—and her twenty percent beer discount. Level Two kept the work simple, quick, forgettable. Her mana flow meant no one noticed the threads that cut through steel, which meant no one looked too close at Anathema. Which meant no one asked why a Doll moved like that. Why she never tired. Why her neck carried marks no tattoo artist had inked.
Rei's interference during their qualification exam had saved them both. Anathema's casual display of strength would have raised questions they couldn't answer.
Morning would bring Mirtha's coffee and Tomé's sad face. Then the board. Then whatever scraps the guild offered. Then more waiting. Always waiting.
The water cooled around her. Steam rose from her skin, and with it came fragments—thin arms, hollow stomach, streets that stretched endless. Fists and spit and voices that cursed her bloodline. Cursed what she was. What her father made her. What they tried to unmake on an altar she still saw when she closed her eyes.
Then light.
Hands that held her. Tears on soft skin. A voice that broke on promises.
"No more hurt. No more pain. No more fighting, no more blood. I promise, I promise, you won't be alone."
The word sat on her tongue but wouldn't leave. Liar. She had Anathema—guardian, companion, sword and shield, shaped by divine hands to walk beside her. Shaped so she'd never have to walk alone again, the goddess said. Bound so tightly their souls tangled.
Not alone.
The goddess left anyway.
She pulled herself from the bath, skipped food—her body didn't need it, but the routine soothed something restless in her chest—and collapsed onto the bed wrapped in her robe.
The dreams found her fast. The same streets. The same hunger. The same knife held above her ribs. The same light that promised everything and delivered silence.
The main hall stretched wide, morning light cutting through high windows in dusty beams. Quest boards lined the wall in organized rows—paper nailed over paper, some edges curled from moisture, others crisp and new. Level One through Three missions clustered together like market stalls. The higher-tier work lived elsewhere, tucked away where curious eyes wouldn't wander.
Azael scanned the postings, her threads already out, invisible filaments spreading like spider silk across the board. Through them she read without touching—ink patterns translating into words, mana signatures revealing which quests drew the most attention.
"Missing livestock," she muttered. "Herb collection. Festival cleanup—still?"
Anathema stood at her shoulder, roots shifting in their sockets as he processed the air pressure around each posting. His presence drew stares, but fewer than before. The guild had grown accustomed to the wooden figure that moved with her.
"Nothing offensive yet."
"Give it time."
Footsteps approached—measured, deliberate. Azael didn't need to turn to recognize them.
Marvenna's voice cut through the hall's ambient noise.
"Good to see you upright."
Azael glanced over. The scribe stood with perfect posture, hair pulled severe, arms crossed beneath her ledger.
"Good news first." Marvenna's mouth barely moved. "New mission. Growing pumpkins that scream when harvested. Farmer's losing his mind. Right up your alley."
"Perfect. What's the bad news?"
"New guild leader wants reclassification exams. All levels." Marvenna's eyes settled on her like weights. "Including Expert."
Azael blinked.
"I definitely want that quest, and—wait, new leader? Did the old one die or something?"
Marvenna snorted.
"No. Sadly." She shifted the ledger against her hip. "She's a big shot. Royal blood. Experience in both wars and quests. Says she wants to make this guild bigger than the capital's."
Azael's fingers drummed against her thigh.
"When's the exam? Maybe I'll do it."
"If you don't, say goodbye to the beer discount." Marvenna's tone stayed flat. "You have two days to prepare. Technically longer, but you aren't here often."
"I'm always at the tavern. Heard nothing about this."
"Now you did." Marvenna leaned closer, voice dropping. "Listen. Rei's off. Won't be here for weeks. She won't be around to bail you out."
Azael grinned.
"Why, are you worried about me? That's cute."
"Don't make me regret being nice to you."
"Will think about it. Now where's that quest? I can do two at once if they're near, right?"
Marvenna hummed.
"They do say this new leader is very generous to Special Adventurers. Came with her own people."
"Good for Rei and those two other guys whose names I forget."
Marvenna didn't laugh.
"It would be nice for us to have more local Special Adventurers."
Azael raised an eyebrow.
"Don't tell me you fell for Rei's delusion. I'm not some powerhouse sorceress hiding my abilities… or I'd definitely be charging more."
Marvenna shrugged.
"Just let the thought sink in. A Special Adventurer is more likely to walk around with something like Anathema. Easier to justify."
"Oh dear, you are worried about me."
"You're insufferable. Get out."


The pumpkins had been exactly as advertised—bloated orange things that shrieked like dying rabbits when she cut them from the vine. The first one made Azael's jaw tighten. By the fifth, she'd stopped flinching.
She crouched near the edge of the field, fingers brushing dirt that felt too warm, too sticky. The soil clung to her skin in dark clumps that smelled wrong—sweet and sharp at once, like fruit left to rot in honey.
"I feel an odd smell from the field."
Anathema's roots twitched, his weight shifting as he processed vibrations through the earth.
"There is something wrong on the ground."
Azael wiped her hand on her pants, grimacing at the residue.
"Farmer probably used something he shouldn't have. Growth potion, maybe. Something to make them bigger or faster."
The pumpkins sat in crooked rows, their stems thick as wrists, their skin stretched taut enough to show pale veins beneath the orange. Natural growth didn't look like that. Natural growth didn't scream.
Anathema stepped closer, roots fanning wider in his sockets.
"Should we tell the farmer?"
Azael shook her head, standing and brushing dirt from her knees.
"It's superficial potion work. I don't think it seeped the land enough to be an issue, but we should definitely tell Marvenna."
"Agreed."
She pulled her threads from her palms, letting them spread thin across the field like a net. The invisible filaments slid through stems with surgical precision, cutting clean while she lifted each pumpkin with careful tension. The screams came in waves—short, sharp bursts that made her teeth ache—but this way at least they didn't suffer long.
Anathema carried the harvest in both arms, stacked high enough to block where his face would have been if he'd had one. The pumpkins had gone quiet, reduced to soft whimpers that faded into silence.
Quick. Clean. Less traumatic than hacking at them with a blade.

Back at the tower, Azael dropped her coat on the couch and rolled her shoulders. The screaming still echoed in her skull, faint but persistent.
Anathema set the last of the pumpkins near the door, then turned toward her.
"If we take the test…" His voice came slow, deliberate. "I will hold back better."
Azael grabbed her robe from the hook, already moving toward the bathroom.
"Don't worry, dear. We just need basic level Adventurer status or I lose the discount."
"And Rei gets mad."
Azael paused, hand on the doorframe. Her mouth lifted at one corner.
"That would be the fun part."
She could picture it—Rei's face cycling through confusion, frustration, that earnest concern she wore like armor. The way her hands would move too fast while she tried to explain why they needed to try harder, to push for Expert rank, to stop hiding.
Rei meant well. Rei always meant well. But Rei didn't understand that some things weren't worth the attention they'd bring.
The bath ran hot enough to fog the mirror. Azael sank into it and let the heat work at the knots in her spine. The screaming pumpkins faded. The sticky-sweet smell of wrong earth faded. Only the water remained, and the steady pulse behind her ribs that told her Anathema hadn't wandered far.
Tomorrow meant turning in the quest. Meant Marvenna's dry commentary and the coins that kept her fed, housed, drunk. Meant another check on the calendar, another fifteen days closer to the exam she'd probably take just to watch Rei's reaction.
The goddess had promised no more fighting.
But she'd never said anything about tests.
Azael closed her eyes and let the steam rise.


* * *
Seraphine, the hero from the capital, arrives a the trial days following her mentour, Irene. In there, she meets Azael, whose constant mana, weird companion and complete disregard for the exam, call her attention.
The trials end and Ananas and Val are promoted to Specialist. Seraphine and Sora tell Irene about Azael's mana.

Seraphine crossed her arms, letting her gaze drift over the betting board's glittering display. The silver nameplates caught the morning light, each one surrounded by copper and brass tokens stacked like tiny fortifications. Ananas had accumulated a small mountain—mostly Expert-level predictions, a few optimistic Specialist votes. Val's pile leaned similarly, though his crowd hedged more conservatively toward Advanced.
Standard fare. Veterans chasing rank, desperate enough to submit to Irene's new evaluation criteria.
The board hummed with low-stakes excitement, guild members clustering around their favorites, murmuring odds and past achievements. Seraphine had breezed through her own trials years ago, the whole affair lasting maybe an hour before the examiners called it and stamped her papers. Nothing in that sterile room had compared to the special quests that came after—the ones where the King himself signed the orders and failure meant more than wounded pride.
"Still mad, huh?"
Selene's voice cut through her assessment. Seraphine kept her eyes on the board, jaw tight.
"I know you don't respect my feelings, but you could at least pretend."
"We broke up like a year ago." Selene shifted her weight, that casual slouch she always adopted when trying to appear unbothered. "How was I supposed to know that kissing someone else in front of you would get you mad?"
Heat flared behind Seraphine's ribs. She'd survived worse than Selene's deflections—the Deadlands incursion, the siege at Greymark, that nightmare contract in the Singing Caves. She could survive standing guard with her ex.
"I'll walk around. See if I find something interesting."
"Can I—"
"No."
She moved before Selene could finish, boots clicking against polished stone. Distance helped. Movement helped. Focusing on Irene's meticulously laid plans helped—the fortification of the West, the cultivation of local leadership, the careful seeding of adventurers who'd earn the smaller towns' trust. Her kingdom's twenty Heroes weren't enough, not against neighboring forces that doubled their numbers. They needed depth. Quality over scattered celebrity.
Irene had thought of everything. Seraphine was the plan's sword, and swords didn't sulk over old wounds.
She circled back to the betting board, scanning past the obvious favorites. The veterans would perform exactly as expected—competent, reliable, forgettable. Irene needed more than that. She needed potential that could grow into something their enemies wouldn't anticipate.
A name near the bottom caught her attention. Few tokens surrounded it, the distribution bizarre—three copper pieces marked Level One, four clustered at Level Two, and then, isolated like a dare, a single silver token stamped with "Specialist."
Azael.
Seraphine leaned closer. Someone thought this candidate was initiate material. Someone else believed they warranted the guild's second-highest classification.
She glanced toward where Irene stood, posture perfect, light green eyes cataloging every detail with that serene focus that made people confess things they hadn't meant to say. Her mentour tracked patterns others missed, saw three moves ahead in conversations that felt like small talk.
But Seraphine's job was different. She watched for what the patterns didn't show—the exceptions, the variables that made strategies crumble or crystallize into something sharper.
Her gaze returned to the name. Azael. No veteran accolades listed, no documented feats that would justify either extreme of the betting spread.
Just a single Specialist vote sitting beside beginner predictions like a challenge.
Seraphine's fingers drummed against her belt. Trial days bored her. But this—this might prove interesting after all.

The reception desk occupied a corner of the main hall, half-buried under stacks of parchment and leather-bound registries. Marvenna's quill scratched a final note across a candidate's form, her severe posture unbending even as she blotted the ink and set the page aside.
"Next," the scribe said, though no one stood in line.
"The name at the bottom of the board." Seraphine planted a hand on the desk. "Azael. Single Specialist vote, rest scattered between initiate and Level Two. What's the story?"
Marvenna's expression didn't shift. She squared the parchment stack with precise fingers.
"Lowkey. Fast. Confident when it counts." The words came measured, deliberate—the way Marvenna delivered everything. "Trustworthy. The spread doesn't surprise me."
Seraphine tilted her head. "Was it your vote?"
Marvenna didn't answer. But something moved behind those composed eyes—a flicker, warm and brief, directed over Seraphine's shoulder. The corners of her mouth lifted.
"You're late."
Seraphine turned.
The woman walking through the hall wasn't dressed for a trial. Black slacks cut sharp at the ankle, a white shirt that fit like it had been tailored to her frame, and a red coat slung open over her shoulders. Sunglasses sat on her nose, dark enough to hide half her face. Her right hand held an iced coffee, condensation bleeding down the glass. Behind her, a figure followed—massive, silent, moving with a fluidity that made Seraphine's breath catch. Too still to be a Doll. Too alive to be a Golem. Its joints didn't click or whir the way enchanted constructs did, but its face held no expression, no micro-movements of breath or thought.
The woman pushed her sunglasses up into her hair and Seraphine's stomach dropped a half-inch. Her eyes were wrong—blue past the point of natural, the kind of color that belonged to gemstones or deep glacial water, not human irises. Black ink crawled up her neck in symmetrical patterns, flame or claw, branching along her jaw like something alive had scorched its way from her collarbone to her face.
"They raised the beer tax." Azael reached the desk and set her coffee down with a dull thud. "Who does that?"
Marvenna smirked. "And I bet the taverns are already adjusting the price."
"Pigs, all of them." Azael waved a hand. "So, fine. I'm here for Level One position, please. Let's do it fast."
Marvenna's quill paused mid-dip. "Level One? You're already Level Two. At least attempt Level Three."
"Didn't your leader change all the mana level requirements?" Azael leaned a hip against the desk. "I wouldn't pass even if I wanted to."
"I'm sure if you did the trial correctly—"
Azael reached across the reception desk, palm flat on the wood, close enough that Marvenna had to look up.
"Listen. You and Rei need to stop believing I'm something grand hiding. I'm not. So—Level One. Please."
Marvenna exhaled through her nose. The sigh of a woman who'd had this conversation enough times to know its shape by heart.
"You know Rei will throw a fit, right?"
Azael's mouth curved. "And that's what makes this fun."
Seraphine watched Marvenna fill the credentials, stamp them, slide the card across. She knew Rei—had trained with her, shared rations during outland excursions where the air tasted like ash and the ground moved wrong. Rei was the Specialist of this town, her influence heavier than the previous guild leader's. Rei didn't waste admiration on people who hadn't earned it.
But this woman's mana read low. Disturbingly low. Barely enough for Level Two, nowhere near Three. The guardian behind her registered the same—faint, almost absent, a reading so flat it made Seraphine blink and try again. If Azael was burning her reserves to sustain the construct, the numbers should fluctuate. They didn't. They sat there, flat and impossible, like staring at a wall and being told it was a window.
Azael collected her credentials, plucked up her coffee, and left—slurping loud enough that two nearby candidates glanced over in irritation.
Seraphine watched her go.
"What did I just see?"
Marvenna shrugged. "A lazy idiot."
"Should I keep my eyes on her?"
"Depends on what you expect to see." Marvenna returned to her parchment. "Rei adores her. Constantly drags her on missions."
Seraphine's brow creased. "Special missions? A Level Two?"
Marvenna looked up. "Curious, isn't it?"
"Maybe they have an affair."
A chuckle—low, genuine, rare from the scribe. "Would you take your crushes to special missions? Be honest."
The question landed like a fist. She wouldn't. Even partnering with Selene during their time together had made her chest tight with a dread that had nothing to do with combat. Those missions killed faster than she could shout at someone to run.
She pushed off the desk and walked away, the image of glacial blue eyes and flat mana readings burning behind her thoughts like a coal she couldn't stop touching.
Seraphine had expected the Level One trials to feel like a formality—clean eliminations, nervous stumbles, maybe one or two surprises worth noting in her report. Instead, she stood at the edge of the fighting arena watching Azael lean against the railing, sunglasses back on, coffee drained and discarded.
The woman yawned.
Around them, candidates stretched, checked their gear, whispered last-minute strategies. Veterans mingled with fresh recruits, the older hunters still sharp despite their lack of magic, the younger ones vibrating with anticipation. Standard crowd. Standard nerves.
Azael looked like she'd wandered in from a bar.
Seraphine circled the perimeter, pausing at the mana measurement station. The official—a thin man with gray threading his temples—glanced up as she flashed her credentials.
"Hero Seraphine." He straightened. "Can I help you?"
"The measurements from the candidate who just passed through. Azael. Black coat, neck tattoos."
He shuffled through his ledger, finger tracing down a column. "Ah. Yes. Low reserves, consistent baseline. Nothing unusual for Level One." He tapped a second notation. "The construct registered the same. Standard readings."
Seraphine's pulse quickened. "Show me."
The numbers matched what she'd sensed earlier—barely enough mana to qualify, hovering at the threshold between Level One and Two. The construct's reading sat identically flat.
"Rei always requests copies of her measurements," the official said. "Should I prepare one for you as well?"
Seraphine nodded. "Please."
She pocketed the parchment and moved toward the fighting arena. Azael stood near the preparation area now, the construct beside her—still, silent, massive. Close enough to hear conversation, Seraphine slowed her approach.
"—told you to sleep early."
Seraphine's breath caught. The voice came from the construct. Deep, smooth, vaguely masculine. Its mouth didn't move. Its face remained blank as carved wood.
Golems didn't speak. Ever. No vocal cords, no sentience to form words, no personality to shape tone. Dolls could talk—their enchantments mimicked speech, parroted commands, sometimes developed quirks over years of use. But Dolls didn't move like this. They clicked, jerked, their joints audible even across crowded rooms.
This thing moved like water.
The referee called the first match. Azael stepped back, hands loose at her sides. The construct advanced into the ring.
Seraphine positioned herself near the viewing platform, focus narrowing. Her mana reading sharpened—the sixth sense she'd honed since childhood, the skill that had saved her life more times than her sword. She tracked the flow of energy like breathing, felt the rise and fall of reserves, the spike of expenditure, the gradual recovery. Combat turned mana volatile. Even masters couldn't maintain perfect stillness under pressure.
The construct engaged. Its opponent—a younger man wielding twin daggers—darted left, testing range. The construct didn't flinch. It stepped forward, arm sweeping in a wide arc that forced the man to roll back.
Seraphine watched Azael.
Nothing. No fluctuation. No dip in reserves, no surge to sustain the construct's movements. Her mana sat flat, unchanging, a lake without wind.
The construct won in three exchanges, movements precise and devastating. The referee called the match.
Seraphine moved to the measurement station. "Did you track reserves during combat?"
The official consulted his notes. "Yes. No change. Candidate maintained baseline throughout."
Her jaw tightened. She pulled the communication crystal from her belt, thumb pressing the activation rune.
"Can you come here? Fast."
Sora's voice crackled through. "Where?"
"Level One arena."
A pause. "What? Why are you there?"
"Just come. See if I'm getting crazy."
She cut the connection and returned to the preparation area. Azael was chatting with an older hunter now—grizzled, no magic to speak of, just decades of experience and steady aim. The construct stood a few paces back, head turning slightly.
Toward Seraphine.
Its hand lifted. A wave. Tentative, almost shy.
Dolls didn't initiate gestures. They responded to commands, mimicked behaviors their owners reinforced. They didn't notice observation and react independently.
Sora appeared at her elbow, slightly breathless. "The Level Seven battle was setting up well—"
"Look at that woman." Seraphine cut her off. "Red coat, neck tattoos."
"Near the wood golem?"
"It's not a golem. It spoke."
Sora blinked. "A Doll, then?"
"I'm not sure either."
Sora's gray eyes narrowed, her focus shifting inward. Seraphine waited, watching her friend's expression cycle through confusion, concentration, deeper confusion.
"Weird, but I'm not seeing anything alarming. Level One at most. Low reserves. Really low." Sora frowned. "It's a wonder that Doll is standing and so big."
"Watch the fight."
The second match started. Same precision, same efficiency. The construct won again, two victories securing Azael's trial completion.
Sora's breathing changed. "Maybe—"
"All her mana readings were exactly the same," Seraphine said.
Sora turned, face pale. "That's not possible. Unless she wasn't using any mana at all, but she fought and the Doll—her reserves should fluctuate like mad."
"Exactly."
"What the hell."
"Right?" Seraphine crossed her arms. "It's not me, right? Your mana reading is even better than mine."
"You told Irene?"
"I mean, tell her what? There's this low-level adventurer whose mana is so low and constant it freaks me out?"
"Yes. That sums it up." Sora's gaze tracked back to Azael. "Is she new?"
"No. Apparently Level Two, and with the new requirements, now Level One. Rei's fond of her."
"So Rei knows?" Sora's voice sharpened. "What did the scribe say?"
"Vague. But she did bet that woman could get Specialist."
Sora's frown carved deeper. "Specialist. With that mana?"
"Yeah." Seraphine exhaled. "And that's why I'm here."
The report table sat cluttered with credentials and performance assessments—weeks of observation condensed into leather portfolios stamped with the guild seal. Irene traced a finger along the edge of Ananas's file, not reading, just thinking. Light filtered through the high windows, catching dust motes that drifted through the silence.
Seraphine shifted her weight. She'd delivered stranger intelligence before—encrypted enemy movements, contradictory scout reports, supply chains that made no mathematical sense. But this felt different. Personal. Like admitting she'd seen something impossible and expected Irene to validate it.
Sora stood beside her, shoulders tense.
"Marvenna." Irene glanced toward the scribe. "You delivered your analysis in the report. I want your actual opinion."
Marvenna's posture didn't change, but something flickered behind her eyes—disappointment, maybe, buried fast beneath professional neutrality.
"Ananas is intelligent. Fast. All his quests conclude perfectly." She paused. "However, he treats difficulty as status. I worry he may let situations worsen before intervening. He's also terrible with victims and survivors."
Irene nodded. "And Val?"
"Best at handling victims. Strong, resilient. But she lacks theoretical knowledge for certain quest types." Marvenna's tone softened slightly. "The advantage is her companion—a Level Eight mage who compensates."
"If you were in a dangerous situation," Irene said, "who would you prefer?"
Marvenna didn't hesitate. "If I was in danger, then Rei or Ironjaw. If people I love were in danger, then Azael." She tilted her head. "Between Val and Ananas, Val."
"Azael?" Irene's brow lifted.
"A Level One adventurer," Seraphine said.
Irene and Selene exchanged glances. Selene's mouth opened slightly, then closed.
"You would prefer a Level One adventurer," Irene said slowly, "over the other Specialists?"
Marvenna nodded.
Selene leaned forward. "The question was about needing Specialist power. Not... whatever Level One adventurers do."
"It doesn't change my answer." Marvenna's voice stayed level. "You asked my preference. I gave it."
Irene scanned the table—files stacked neatly, all candidates Level Four and above. She looked at Seraphine. "What do you think? You seem to know this person."
"I was curious." Seraphine chose her words carefully. "She's Level One. Level Two before you changed the mana requirements."
"And?"
"I don't know." The admission tasted wrong. "Her mana levels are very low, but there's something about her. Her Doll won fights so easily that Level One seems... wrong."
"She won easily but didn't meet the mana requirements?" Irene frowned. "That's new."
"Is it possible she's pushing her mana level down on purpose?" Selene asked.
"Very rarely." Sora's fingers twisted together. "Most people try to push theirs up. Down is terribly complicated."
Irene hummed, gaze settling on Marvenna. "Do you know more than you're telling me?"
"I know nothing else about her, except Rei trusted her." Marvenna met her eyes. "I also do."
"Very curious." Irene leaned back. "Anything else?"
Sora nudged Seraphine forward. Seraphine cleared her throat. "I don't know how to explain this, but her mana level is constant."
"If she won easily, probably."
"No." Seraphine's jaw tightened. "Her mana is constant. Like a line. No variation at all."
Irene stopped. "What do you mean, a line?"
"No variation. At all."
"If she has a Doll, it's impossible her mana is constant."
"That's what I said," Sora cut in. "But it's truly constant. The same digit in all readings."
Irene looked at Marvenna. "Is that correct?"
Marvenna nodded. "It puzzled us too. That's why Rei kept saying the mana requirements shouldn't be taken so seriously—at least regarding Azael."
Irene sighed, long and weary. "Why is everything weird connected to Rei?"
Marvenna chuckled. "I honestly ask myself this constantly."

Chapter 2
The Full Child Eater Arc (Days 6-9):
Azael noticing the smell and searching for 3 days
Bia's disappearance
The nest infiltration with Tomé's eyes cutting through illusion
Finding Irene's team trapped in vines
The battle (with detailed breakdown of who did what)
The aftermath/reckoning at guild
Major Character Updates showing what everyone knows NOW:
Seraphine: Felt the invisible nets catch her, saw constant mana during combat, fought in sync with Anathema, now FULLY committed to investigation
Irene: Realized she fucked up ignoring Rei's reports, suspended both Specialists, publicly admitted mistake, wants to apologize to Rei
Azael: Saved all the kids but is now under surveillance, demonstrated abilities in front of witnesses, can't stay invisible anymore
Specialists (Val & Ananas): SUSPENDED, exposed as incompetent, didn't read reports, more worried about Level 1 than saving kids
The Systemic Failure Documentation:
Rei's 23 critical Level 1 assets (Clara, Damion & Ann, Celeste, Cecil, the cook)
All lost access due to mana requirements
Rei warned capital REPEATEDLY (ignored every time)
Clara couldn't report missing children after losing Level 1 status
Direct line from bureaucracy → kids almost dying
Power Dynamics Completely Shifted:
Before: Specialists elite/untouchable, mana levels = respect, Azael was minor curiosity
After: Specialists suspended/discredited, mana levels proven inadequate, Azael is priority investigation/potential asset, Irene acknowledges mistakes

 
Azael noticed the smell.
Rot and despair and blood, clinging to the air like grease on skin. She'd tracked it through the market square, down near the docks, circling the residential quarter twice. Anathema followed, silent as always, his heavy footfalls disturbing the cobblestones.
They found nothing.
"Three days." Azael wiped her palms on her thighs, squinting at the afternoon light. "Getting stronger."
Anathema's head tilted. The roots where his eyes should've been twisted slightly, sensing vibrations she couldn't feel. "It has not crossed the market boundary."
"Then why can I smell it this clearly?"
"I do not know."
Azael carved sigils into scraps of wood that night—protective marks, old ones she'd learned before the Goddess vanished. She tucked them beneath Mirtha's windowsill, behind the bakery's foundation stones, underneath the step where Tomé always sat to eat his lunch. Small things. Probably useless.
Anathema watched her work. "The scent worries you."
"Yeah."
"I would know if something came near the bakery."
"Would you?" Azael pressed the last sigil into a crack in the mortar. "Because I'm smelling it everywhere and you're telling me it hasn't moved."
"I do not lie."
"Didn't say you did." She straightened, brushing dirt from her knees. "But something's wrong."
The guild hall smelled like parchment and lamp oil. Azael scanned the quest board—standard fare, escort missions, pest control, a fetch request for rare herbs. Nothing about rot. Nothing about disappearances.
Marvenna looked up from her desk when Azael approached.
"Quest about a smell," Azael said. "Rot. Blood. Anything?"
Marvenna's expression shifted—concern threading through her usual neutrality. "Not on the general board."
"Anywhere else?"
"Specialist board." Marvenna set down her quill. "Missing children. Reports of a strong odor preceding the disappearances."
Azael's jaw tightened. "Someone took it?"
"Yes. Two days ago."
Azael exhaled. Fine. Specialists knew what they were doing. She nodded once and left.
The tower stairs felt longer than usual. Azael shoved the door open, already planning to sleep for twelve hours straight, maybe convince Anathema to stop hovering—
Elena stood near the base of the tower, hands knotted together. Tomé beside her, eyes red-rimmed.
"Is Bia here?!" Elena's voice cracked.
"Bia is gone!" Tomé clutched at his shirt.
Azael stopped. "What?"
"Please, is she here? Did she come to you?"
"Slow down." Azael descended the last few steps. "What happened?"
Inside Mirtha's bakery, the warmth felt wrong. Too bright. Too normal.
Elena sat hunched over the table, words spilling out fast and jagged. "She was sad. Too sad. Wouldn't eat. Slept all the time. I thought—heartbreak, maybe, but it got worse. I was going to take her to a doctor, I swear, I just needed to save a little more—"
"Elena." Azael leaned forward. "What happened tonight?"
"I worked my shift. Came home. She was gone." Elena's breath hitched. "Her room smelled like rot and dirt. No broken windows. No forced entry. Nobody saw anything. She's just—gone."
Azael's blood went cold.
Anathema shifted behind her, roots curling tighter in their sockets.
"When did you last see her?" Azael's voice came out flat.
"Yesterday evening. She said she was tired. Went to bed early."
"And the smell?"
"Strong. Like something died in there."
Azael stood. "I'm going to her room."
"Now?" Mirtha's hand hovered near Elena's shoulder.
"Now."
Azael pulled Tomé close before Elena could protest. "You and Mirtha ask around. Anyone who saw her leave. Anything unusual."
Elena's face crumpled. "But—"
"We'll check her usual spots." Azael kept her tone level, casual. "Kids wander. She might've just needed air."
Mirtha caught Azael's eye, reading something in the set of her jaw. She squeezed Elena's shoulder. "Come on. We'll start with the neighbors."
The moment they left, Azael turned to Anathema. Her threads coiled tight around her palms, invisible to everyone but her. "Tomé's safety is priority one. Understood?"
The elemental's roots shifted. "Understood."
Bia's room stank.
Azael pressed her fingers against the windowsill, the bedframe, the floorboards. Residue clung to everything—thick, cloying, wrong. Not physical. Metaphysical. The kind of stain that seeped into reality and twisted it.
" Aza?" Tomé stood in the doorway, pale. "What are we looking for?"
"Anything that doesn't belong." Azael crouched near the bed. Her threads spread across the floor, tasting the air. "Tell me what you smell."
Tomé stepped inside, nose wrinkling. He inhaled. Paused. "Sweets. Like... honey cakes. Fresh ones."
Azael's jaw tightened.
Sweets.
Not rot.
"Anathema."
"I hear it."
She stood, pulse steady despite the ice spreading through her chest. "Come on, Tomé. Outside."
The street stretched empty in the lamplight. Azael walked slow, letting her threads drift outward, searching for that residue. Tomé followed, quiet for once.
"Do you smell anything different?" Azael asked.
Tomé sniffed. His eyes widened. "Yes! The honey cakes again. It's... that way." He pointed toward the western edge of the residential quarter.
They followed.
The smell led them past shuttered homes, through an alley, toward a dead-end wall. Azael's threads recoiled when they touched it—reality buckling, warping, wrong.
She felt stone. Solid brick. An empty stretch of architecture.
"There's a cave," Tomé whispered.
Azael looked at him. "What do you see?"
"A big opening. With lights inside. Pretty ones."
Anathema's roots curled inward. "I sense nothing. But the ground—" He paused. "—shifts. Reality is not stable here."
Azael extended a thread. It passed through the wall like water through gauze. No resistance. Just... absence.
A glamour. A den.
"Tomé." Azael knelt, meeting his eyes. "I need you to guide us. Can you do that?"
The boy nodded, small hands clenching into fists.
They stepped through.
Darkness swallowed them whole. Azael's threads fanned out, mapping space by absence—high ceiling, wide expanse, emptiness. The air tasted stale. Dead.
" Aza?" Tomé's voice trembled. "The festival's right there."
Azael's blood chilled.
"Describe it."
"There's... stalls. Lots of them. Empty, but decorated. Ribbons and paper lanterns. Colors everywhere." Tomé's breathing quickened. "It looks fun. But nobody's here."
Anathema shifted closer, wood creaking. His presence solid, grounding.
Azael released a slow breath. Smart predators understood prey. They built traps that felt safe—parks for the lonely, treehouses for the adventurous, festivals for the hungry.
Whatever took Bia knew exactly what children wanted.
"Tomé." Azael kept her voice calm. "Walk toward the prettiest stall. Tell me everything you see."
Chitin cracked beneath invisible blades.
Azael's threads retracted, slick with ichor. Her jaw ached—teeth clenched too tight, grinding molars that didn't need protecting. Sweat gathered at her nape despite the cool air. She hated sweating. Hated the crawl of moisture down her spine, the physical betrayal of limits she'd left behind.
Tomé hummed ahead, hand tucked safely in Anathema's wooden fingers.
The passage narrowed. Darkness pressed close—or what passed for darkness here, where mana saturated every breath until Azael's threads tasted nothing but distortion. Too thick. Reality kept shifting beneath her senses, glamours layering over glamours until even her vision blurred.
"There's two ways." Tomé's whisper barely carried. "One's bright. Smells like popcorn. The other's dark and smells like... Grandma's roasted pork."
His stomach growled.
Azael's threads stopped searching.
Frighten them with shadows or tempt them with sweets.
Smart.
"Which one do you want?"
"The pork one." Hesitation threaded through his voice. "I'm really hungry."
"Then we go that way."
Anathema's roots coiled tighter as they walked, sensing vibrations that shouldn't exist. Something skittered in the blackness ahead. Multiple somethings—legs moving in coordinated rhythm, chitinous bodies scraping stone.
Movement rippled through the dark.
Azael's threads became scalpels.
Pieces scattered across invisible stone. Silent. Surgical. Ichor pooled in shadows Tomé couldn't see, wouldn't see—just fair vendors offering treats, performers juggling colored balls, other children laughing and beckoning him closer.
The cellar. Chains. Prayers spoken over broken skin while adults measured her worth in sacrifice.
Her threads spread wider, carving through another wave without thought. Fur and chitin parted beneath white strings sharp enough to split steel. Spider-things large as hunting dogs collapsed mid-lunge, six gleaming eyes dimming before they hit ground.
Tomé kept humming.
Anathema's roots shifted toward her—concern radiating through stillness, through the way bark groaned beneath strain. She didn't look at him. Her threads mapped territory through violence instead, tracing branching paths and too many doors.
All leading inward.
All leading to the center.
And there—beneath layers of distortion and mana-thick air—her threads found them.
Heartbeats. Small ones. Too many.
Still beating.
Thank fuck.
But for how long?
Her fingers curled into fists. Nails bit crescents into palms that didn't bleed.
"Almost there!" Tomé's voice carried false brightness the glamour fed him. "The festival's getting louder!"
Azael's threads trembled—fury suppressed beneath control wearing thinner with each step.
"Good," she said. Voice flat. Empty. "Keep walking."
Her threads reacted to something different—a tremor in the mana-saturated air, a pattern that didn't match the glamour's pulse. Anathema's roots twisted, sensing vibrations that moved wrong. Too fast. Too frantic.
Tomé frowned, squinting at something Azael couldn't see. "What is that?"
Azael extended a thread toward the disturbance. Metal. Enchanted. Moving in tight, desperate circles.
A magic tool, plane-shaped and small enough to fit in a palm. It spun through the air like a trapped wasp, circling the same ten-meter radius over and over. The mana density here would scramble any navigation spell—her own threads would be just as lost without Tomé's eyes cutting through the glamour.
"It seems lost," Tomé whispered.
"It is lost."
Which meant her threads were correct. More people had entered this mess. Adults. Maybe the team Marvenna mentioned, the ones who took the contract. But what kind of idiots walked into something like this unprepared?
"So we look for its owner?" Anathema's voice rumbled low.
"No. We don't have time." Azael started forward. "Mirtha will scream at us if the kids miss their dinners."
"I'm hungry," Tomé added quietly.
"Let's continue."
Despite Tomé's best efforts, despite following the path he swore led deeper, they circled back. Same corridor. Same lost device spinning its frantic loops.
"I'm sorry." Tomé's voice cracked. "I thought—"
"Not your fault." Azael stared at the device. The creature running this den had probably identified them. No—identified the device's owner. More likely, since her mana sat too low to trigger suspicion and Anathema rarely registered as anything but stone.
"Dumbasses."
She turned toward a different passage, gesturing for Anathema to follow. He shifted Tomé higher against his chest, becoming a wall of living wood between the boy and whatever waited ahead.
Voices filtered through the darkness. Human. Adult.
Tomé heard it first, perking up. Azael caught it seconds later—familiar cadences, stressed breathing, the sharp snap of someone giving orders.
Her threads found them before her eyes did.
An adventurer group, pinned against the wall by massive vines that squeezed tighter with each struggle. She recognized the mana signatures from the trials—Val's brash overflow, Ananas' shadow-threaded reserve, and that impossible golden brilliance she'd noticed in the hero.
Seraphine. The one with the most beautiful aura she'd ever seen—radiant, warm, utterly captivating in a way that made Azael's vision linger despite herself.
"What are you doing here?" Ananas' voice cut through the shadows.
They all turned. Azael shrugged. "What are you doing here?"
Val struggled harder. The vines constricted around her ribs.
"You should stop that." Anathema's tone carried no inflection. "Those vines will just squeeze tighter."
"Shut up!" Val snarled. "I won't take orders from a tree."
Tomé gasped. Azael tilted her head. "That was not nice."
"Specialists!" Seraphine snapped, golden eyes blazing even in the dark. "What do we do? Answer the leader."
Irene watched everything in silence. Selene yawned beside her, bored. Lina chuckled. Sora's gray eyes fixed on Azael. "What is that kid doing here?"
"We're looking for his friend. He's safe." Azael gestured at Anathema's protective stance. "More than you all, anyway."
"What do you even know, level one?" Ananas glared.
"Pay attention to our situation!" Sera's voice cracked like a whip. "What are those things and how do we get out?"
Anathema raised one wooden hand. "I know the answer."
"Teacher's pet," Azael muttered.
"Nobody likes the teacher's pet," Tomé added solemnly.
"I liked pets."
"Fuck it all!" Val thrashed again.
"Stop struggling!" Sera's frustration bled through every word. "They'll just get tighter!"
Ananas turned back to Azael. "This place isn't for the likes of you. Rei isn't here to save you."
"Correct me if I'm wrong." Azael kept her tone flat. "But it looks like you're the one who needs saving."
Selene laughed—sharp and genuine.
Irene sighed. "Enough. Lina, please. Get us out."
"Ay!"
Lina fished a small crystal from her shirt pocket, lobbing it at the vines. A long screech split the air, followed by blinding white light. The vines turned to ash.
"Nice trick," Azael said.
"Very smart," Anathema added.
"What was that?!" Val stumbled forward, rubbing her ribs.
Lina grinned. "That's technology, baby."
"You two are Specialists!" Sera rounded on Val and Ananas, fury radiating from every line of her body. "How come you don't know how to act against Parasitic Vines?"
Val shrugged. "I panicked. Never saw it before."
"I got distracted." Ananas glared at Azael.
She chuckled.
"Nobody—and I mean nobody—should keep you from doing your job!" Sera stepped closer, voice dropping to something dangerous. "What if you were with a victim? What if it was the rest of your team? Would you let them all die because you 'got distracted'?"
"You should blame her, not me!"
"Is she the Specialist? No. You are."
"Enough." Irene's voice cut clean through the tension. "Let's continue. We need to know if all the children are alive."
Tomé's eyes widened. "Alive? You mean Bia could be—?"
Azael turned to him, keeping her face neutral. "She's alive. That girl's tough. Don't worry about it."
"Are you sure?"
"Would I lie to you?"

"Yes?" Tomé's brow furrowed. "Like when you said putting salt on the chocolate milk would make it tastier."
Selene doubled over, shoulders shaking with laughter.
Azael sighed. "Okay. Would I lie to you about something really important?"
Tomé shook his head.
"Good. We'll get Bia back. Promise."
He nodded, small fingers gripping Anathema's bark tighter.
"We'll handle it." Ananas stepped forward, shadow magic flickering around his daggers. "Go back up, level one."
"You couldn't even handle parasitic vines."
"Enough." Irene's voice cut clean through the tension. "Specialists, let's try one more time. Now we escort low-level adventurers and a child. Let's see if you handle it better."
"What?" Val's face twisted. "They'll just slow us down!"
Ananas gestured sharply at Azael. "We don't have time for babysitting."
"Well, this was fun. Good luck." Azael turned toward Anathema. She paused, glancing back at Lina. "Is your toy lost? Mana here's all over the place. Won't know where to go."
Lina smirked. "The Specialists suggested it. Guess they were wrong."
"Dumbasses."
"Listen here—!" Ananas started forward.
Val's voice rose over his. "You little shit, you think you're better than—?"
Sera's jaw clenched, frustration bleeding through every taut muscle. Selene kept laughing, wiping tears from her eyes. Sora and Lina exchanged glances—silent communication passing between them in raised eyebrows and subtle head tilts.
Irene stood perfectly still. Her face remained stoic, serene even, but something cold radiated from her presence. These were supposed to be the elite. The guild's best. Yet here they stood, more concerned with pride than the missing children waiting somewhere in this nightmare.
Unacceptable.
"Wait." Tomé sniffed. "This smell..."
Azael looked down at him. "Where?"
Tomé pointed down a branching corridor. "There? Roasted pork again."
Anathema shifted, drawing Tomé closer against his chest. Azael nodded. "Then we go there."
"Are you even listening?!" Ananas' voice cracked with frustration. "You leave! We go after the children!"
"Okay, okay. We're leaving." Azael waved dismissively.
She walked toward the corridor Tomé indicated. Anathema followed, heavy steps echoing against stone.
Selene glanced at Irene. "What do you want to do?"
Irene's gaze remained fixed on the Specialists. "Where do we go now?"
Ananas straightened. "We follow the mana. Try the Pathfinder again."
"Again?" Lina's grin sharpened. "This place has mana everywhere. It'll just get lost."
Val cursed. "Fuck. Then... what? We can't see or follow the mana paths ourselves."
"You tell me."
"This is ridiculous," Sera muttered.
Irene repeated, slower this time, "What do we do?"
Ananas hesitated. His shadows flickered, uncertain.
Val spat another curse. "Fine. Let's follow the weirdo and the tree. At least they seem to know where they're going."
Sera exhaled through her nose. "First smart decision."
Azael had seen Heroes before.
When her goddess still walked the Blessed Realm, Azael would peek through the veil and watch them pass through the forest below. Some carried auras like sunbursts—dazzling, impossible to look away from. Others radiated darkness so deep it swallowed light whole. Each one beautiful in their own way, each one a masterwork of divine investment and mortal ambition.
None of them compared to Seraphine's.
Golden. Warm. The kind of brilliance that made Azael's vision linger despite every instinct screaming to look away. She'd caught herself staring twice already, threads unconsciously reaching toward that radiance before she forced them back.
Stupid.
"Tomé." Azael kept her tone flat. "Tell me about school."
"Oh!" The boy perked up immediately. "I really like school. This week we learned about fractions and Miss Carla said I was getting really good at them, and then we also had to write a story about our favorite person and I wrote about Grandma because she makes the best bread in the whole kingdom, maybe even the whole world, and—"
Tomé went on and on, voice echoing through the darkness. Anathema's large hand rested steady against his back, grounding. The group fell into formation behind them—Sera and Sora at the front, Irene and Lina flanking, Selene bringing up the rear.
"His voice is annoying me." Ananas' shadows flickered irritably.
Val shifted her weight. "Won't all the talking get us the attention from the thing?"
Sera growled somewhere ahead. The sound carried frustration, but she kept silent.
Lina's voice cut through the tension, amused. "Yes and no. This place is completely dark for us because it's not made for us. If the kid gets pulled under the spell, we lose him too and we're lost." She glanced at Azael. "Is that right?"
Irene nodded before Azael could answer. "He's the only one who sees this world as it's supposed to work. Keeping him tethered to reality is essential to keeping him safe."
Val cursed under her breath. "So that's actually smart? Well, fuck this weirdo for knowing such weird stuff."
"—and then, do you remember Antonio?" Tomé's voice continued, oblivious.
"Bia's crush?" Azael asked.
"Yeah, that stupid kid."
"Language." Anathema's tone held no room for argument.
"Sorry. Anyway, he didn't go to school this week. I bet he's realizing how stupid he is."
"Language."
"Well, he is stupid. Bia's awesome."
Sera's voice rang out behind them—sweet, careful. "Are there many kids not going to school?"
Tomé paused, thinking. "I guess? But I don't know, sorry. I don't really notice that stuff."
"That's fine. Don't worry."
Anathema turned slightly toward Seraphine. "The nun said to Mirtha that the runaway kids had yet to be found. They aren't in the place they usually go."
Sora's gray eyes narrowed. "What runaway kids?"
"It's a group of five," Azael said. "They're usually running away. Anathema and I go after them from time to time."
Tomé nodded vigorously. "Well, I didn't see Dino this week and he's usually always there trying to steal my lunch. But I thought he was just skipping class."
Irene listened to everything, her expression unchanged. She turned to the Specialists. "Are you aware of this?"
Val shook her head. Ananas' shadows coiled tighter. "Problematic kids running away aren't something we usually worry about."
Sera's jaw clenched so hard Azael heard teeth grinding.
Sora's hand landed on her shoulder. "Take a deep breath."
"I'm going to hit someone."
Azael glanced at Tomé. "I didn't know you got your lunch stolen."
"I don't. He's scared of Bia. He tries when she isn't around and I say I'll call her and he stops."
Anathema's roots shifted, almost pleased. "Bia is indeed scary. Smart kid."
Selene tracked movement in the darkness—chitinous bodies lunging from shadows that shouldn't exist, mandibles clicking, too many legs scrambling across stone. She reached for her sword, then stopped.
The creatures fell apart before they came close. Silent. Surgical. Pieces scattering across invisible ground without sound, without struggle. Clean cuts that severed chitin and bone like they were paper.
Not her doing. Not Sera's either—the Hero fought with brutality, not precision. Sora kept to healing, defensive barriers at most. Irene's magic carried a specific temperature shift, fire or ice announcing itself in the mana-thick air. This felt like nothing at all.
Lina's tech? No. She'd admitted earlier the mana density here scrambled her tools.
The Specialists? Selene almost laughed. Those two hadn't noticed a damn thing, too busy sulking to pay attention to their surroundings.
Which left the level one adventurer and her wooden companion.
Interesting.
Sera noticed too. Her golden eyes tracked the darkness, jaw tight with concentration. She nudged Sora, who glanced at the scattered remains and nodded once—silent confirmation passing between them.
"Now, we have two ways to go!" Tomé's voice echoed ahead. "The carousel or the mirror maze. Let's go to the mirror maze!"
Azael's tone came flat. "Aren't you scared of it?"
"Not scared. I don't like it, but Bia does. She would probably go there."
"Let's go then."
Ananas stopped walking. "Are we simply going to follow them?"
Lina glanced back, expression amused. "Do you have a better idea?"
"Following a level one adventurer isn't—"
"BIA!"
Tomé's scream split the air. He launched himself from Anathema's arms, hitting the ground running.
"Follow him. Now." Azael's voice carried no room for argument.
Anathema moved instantly, heavy footfalls pounding after the boy. Roots extended, reaching, wrapping carefully around Tomé's waist and lifting him back despite his thrashing.
"It's her voice! She's asking for help! BIA!"
They regrouped in seconds. Tomé fought against Anathema's hold, small fists beating uselessly against living wood. Azael reached for him, threads coiling protectively around the boy's shoulders.
"Tomé, listen—"
"But she needs—!"
Irene stepped forward, movements deliberate and calm. She reached into her pocket and produced a small wrapped candy. The boy stopped struggling, confusion replacing panic.
Irene smiled. Warm. Genuine. "It's my favorite."
Tomé took the candy with trembling fingers. "Thank you."
"It's a trick." Azael kept her voice level. "Bia isn't screaming. They're luring you. Don't ever do that again."
"But she—!"
Irene knelt, bringing herself to his eye level. "You really love her, don't you?"
The boy nodded, eyes shining with unshed tears.
"Then you need to trust us. This place is very dangerous."
Azael gestured at Irene. "She's the new Guildmaster. Did you know that?"
Tomé's eyes widened. "She is? Like your boss and Rei's boss?"
"Yes." Irene's expression remained serene. "Do you want to hear about the time I went after a chimera?"
"Yes! Was it big?"
"Huge. Three heads, each one breathing a different element. Fire, ice, and poison gas."
They resumed walking, Tomé now tucked securely in Anathema's arms while Irene wove her story. The boy listened, transfixed, candy forgotten in his small fist.
Azael leaned closer to Anathema. "Glue yourself to him. He doesn't leave your sight again."
"Understood."
"I mean it. Physical contact at all times."
Anathema's roots coiled tighter around Tomé's waist and shoulders—gentle but unbreakable. "He will not escape."
Val gestured sharply at Tomé. "It's too dangerous to have this kid here."
Sera rolled her eyes. Selene looked at Irene's back—the Guildmaster held Tomé's hand while the wooden elemental followed close, his massive form creating a protective barrier. Selene's expression shifted, something like respect threading through her usual boredom. "She's good."
Sera nodded. "The best. You two should learn from her instead of complaining."
Lina leaned toward Sora, voice dropping low. "Do you also feel that? It's weird."
Sora kept her gaze forward. "We did. The things being cut apart before getting near us."
"So weird. Who's doing it?"
"Isn't that a good question?"
Sera looked at Azael's back. The mana reading here was a mess—saturated, distorted, impossible to parse cleanly—but Sera understood enough to know that the woman's mana remained constant. No fluctuations. No spikes. The woman didn't even seem aware of what was happening from her posture, attention focused entirely on the boy. Whatever she was doing apparently came as easy as walking.
So weird.
Sora turned to Val. "What do you know about those two?"
Val scoffed. "Level two and now level one. Low mana. Barely do quests. Don't take it seriously. But Rei's always dragging her to high-level missions. They're probably having an affair."
Sora dismissed the last part.
They arrived at the maze—according to Tomé's eyes, at least—and they all felt it. The massive presence looming above them, too large to be contained in this space. Reality buckled.
Tomé frowned. "Why is there a stair here?"
The ceiling broke.
What should've been rock rained down, covering them all with thousands of spider-like creatures. They never hit. Something like a net enveloped the mass, holding it suspended above their heads. Sera looked at Azael, who glanced back—surprised for just a moment—then smirked.
"Behind you."
Selene was faster. Her large sword carved through chitin and flesh, cutting the creature in two before it landed on Sera. She stepped closer, scanning for injuries. "Are you okay?"
Sera nodded. "Thank you. Yes."
The creatures above tried to move, mandibles clicking frantically. The net kept them tied, threads glinting faintly in the darkness.
Anathema held Tomé tighter in his arms. "It's here."
The ground beneath them broke.
The cave underneath was real—stone and mold and dampness that tasted like rot. The illusion shattered. Anathema landed on his feet, Tomé wrapped safely inside his arms. Azael floated down, her threads guiding her like silk on wind. Lina grabbed a toy similar to the plane from earlier, riding it down. Irene descended on a cushion of wind magic, bringing Selene, Val, and Ananas with her. Sera landed hard but steady—and she was sure she felt lines grabbing her arms and legs to soften the impact. They vanished as quickly as they appeared.
The cave was filled with cocoons.
Azael's threads spread wide, tasting heartbeats. Small ones. Weak but alive. Irene's voice came steady. "The children."
Azael nodded.
Val exhaled sharply. "Finally I can see."
"Don't let your guard down!" Sera's hand went to her sword.
The thing emerged then.
Larger than a building, half spider, half humanoid. Eight eyes gleamed in the darkness, mandibles clicking as it smiled—a grotesque expression on a face that almost looked human. It smirked. "Well, well. Free food."
Anathema released Tomé. The boy ran to Azael's arms, wrapping himself around her waist. She held him close, threads already forming a barrier between him and the creature.
Irene's voice cut through the tension. "The priority is the children! Get them all safe!"
The cave erupted.
Holes opened across the walls—dozens of them—and the spiders poured through like black water. Val planted her feet and swung wide, crushing three in a single arc. Ananas dissolved into shadow, his daggers finding joints and soft tissue between chitin plates. Selene moved with lethal economy, her two-handed sword carving paths through the swarm, each strike buying inches of safe ground behind her.
Sera's golden aura ignited.
Heroic magic blazed through her limbs, turning every movement into something beyond human. She charged the creature and Anathema matched her stride for stride—heavy, measured, precise. The thing lashed down with a leg thick as a tree trunk. Sera dodged left; Anathema was already there, wooden arms catching the blow and redirecting it into the stone floor. Sera pivoted, sword biting deep into the joint where chitin met flesh. The creature shrieked. Another leg whipped from behind—Anathema's body shifted, roots spreading wide, absorbing the impact meant for her spine. She didn't look back. Didn't need to. He was already there, filling every gap she left, reading her momentum through vibrations in the ground.
They moved like they'd trained together for years. They hadn't.
Lina sprinted toward the cocoons, Sora half a step behind. More spiders peeled from the walls to intercept—smaller ones, faster, mandibles dripping venom. Fire roared overhead. Irene's magic carved burning lines through the swarm, turning chitin to ash mid-leap. The spiders scattered, regrouped, lunged again. Another wave of fire. This time Irene aimed upward, flame washing across the cocoon cluster's base. The silk melted. Webbing sagged. Split.
Children dropped.
They fell screaming—ten, fifteen, more—and landed on something solid that wasn't there. An invisible surface caught them, firm as stone beneath their bare feet. Some collapsed. Others scrambled upright on shaking legs, eyes wild and unfocused.
"Come! Now! COME!"
Lina's voice cut through the chaos. She stood at the edge of the invisible platform, arms waving, Sora already pulling the nearest child to safety. The kids ran. Stumbled. Crawled. The net guided them down at a gentle slope, depositing them behind the defensive line where Val and Ananas held ground. Selene's sword opened space when the swarm pressed too close, her body a wall between the children and the dark.
Tomé's fingers dug into Azael's hip. "BIA!"
Azael saw her. Third from the last cocoon—face streaked with grime and tears, blonde hair matted flat against her skull, dirty overalls torn at the knee. Bia hit the net running, legs unsteady but furious. Alive. Whole.
Anathema caught a leg meant for Sera's exposed flank. The impact drove his feet into stone, cracks spreading beneath him. He held. Sera read the opening before it fully existed—her body already twisting, sword already singing through air. Heroic magic gathered at the blade's edge, condensed, erupted. The golden arc struck the creature's thorax and it screamed, a sound that cracked stone and made mana ripple like disturbed water.
Another leg swept toward the children still crossing the net.
Azael didn't blink.
The leg split. Clean. Bisected at the joint, the severed half tumbling into darkness while ichor sprayed in a wide arc. The creature screamed again—higher, uglier, confused—thrashing against something it couldn't see or understand.
"Use me to jump." Anathema's voice carried through the noise, flat and certain. "You won't fall."
Sera met his rootless gaze for half a breath. Nodded.
She planted one foot on his outstretched palm and he launched her. Heroic magic flooded her legs, carrying her upward in a streak of gold. The creature lunged, mandibles snapping shut on empty air where she'd been a heartbeat before.
Ice encased its body. Irene's spell crystallized across chitin and flesh, freezing joints, locking limbs. The creature's shriek died to a grinding whine as frost crawled into its mouth.
Sera reached the apex of her arc. Weightless for one suspended moment, sword raised overhead, golden light concentrating along the blade until it burned white. She swung.
The head split open like rotten fruit.
Blood erupted upward—thick, black, reeking of poison and decay. It sprayed across the ceiling, across stone, across everything. Sera twisted midair, bracing for impact, calculating distance and angle and the likelihood of broken bones—
Her feet met something solid.
The net held firm beneath her, invisible and unyielding, strange against her soles. She stood on nothing. Her weight pressed into a surface that shouldn't exist, that gave no visual confirmation of its presence. Her knees bent with the landing's momentum and found perfect resistance pushing back.
The creature's body collapsed. Stone cracked beneath its weight. Ichor pooled in the darkness below, spreading slow and thick.
Sera looked down at her own feet, standing on air.
Bizarre.
Seraphine watched the girl—Bia—sprint across the invisible platform, legs pumping hard despite how they shook. She crashed into Tomé with enough force to send them both stumbling. They clung to each other, dirty hands fisting in torn fabric, faces buried against shoulders.
Then they ran to Azael.
Both kids wrapped themselves around her hips, one on each side. Azael's hands settled on their heads—gentle, steady. No flash of mana. No fluctuation whatsoever. Sera's vision tracked the woman's aura, searching for some spike, some telltale shift that would explain the nets, the severed limbs, the surgical precision that had carved through chitin all night.
Nothing.
Constant. Perfectly, impossibly constant.
Weird.
Anathema passed by her, heavy footsteps echoing across stone. He nodded once—acknowledgment, respect. "Good fight."
Sera blinked. "You too."
The Doll walked back to Azael's side. No limp. No visible strain. His movements carried the same measured weight they had before the battle, like he hadn't spent the last hour catching blows that would've shattered buildings. Golems drained their caster's reserves when pushed hard. Everyone knew that. Extended combat should've left him sluggish, faltering, stuttering through commands while his controller gasped for breath.
But Azael stood perfectly still, one hand resting on Bia's matted hair, the other smoothing Tomé's collar. Both children pressed close, trembling but safe.
Child Eater. That's what they'd fought. A creature that fed on despair, that built playgrounds from stolen joy and devoured hope bite by bite. Monsters like that required entire teams to exterminate. Heroes, usually.
Yet here they stood.
Azael looked up. Their eyes met across the dim cave. The woman's expression softened—just slightly, just enough—and she nodded. Slow. Deliberate. Like she was saying good job.
Sera's chest tightened for reasons she couldn't name.
"What the actual fuck, huh."
Selene appeared at her shoulder, gaze fixed on the same trio. Her tone carried genuine bewilderment beneath the usual drawl.
Sera exhaled. "Yeah."
"That was bizarre."
"Completely."
"You thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Probably not." Sera shifted her weight, muscles still singing with adrenaline. "What are you thinking?"
Selene's mouth curved. "That we should buy her a drink and ask very polite questions."
"Selene."
"What? I'm curious."
Sera was too. But curiosity felt dangerous right now—felt like staring too long at something bright enough to burn.

The guild hall smelled like lamp oil and Irene's fury.
The Guildmaster stood behind her desk, hands flat against wood, shoulders rigid. Her face remained perfectly composed—serene, even—but ice radiated from her in waves that made the air feel thin.
"How?" Her voice cut clean. "How did you let this pass? Why did nobody notice anything wrong?"
Ananas stood with his spine straight, chin lifted. Pride bled from every line of his body, refusal written across features that wouldn't yield even now.
Val shifted her weight, jaw tight. Behind her stood a tall, thin boy—the level eight mage, probably—his face showing too much comprehension for comfort.
Marvenna said nothing. Her expression remained perfectly impassive.
Seraphine looked at the mage. "You want to say something? Do you know why this was ignored for so long?"
Val glanced back at him, then at Sera. "His name is Seb and he knows everything."
The man's cheeks colored slightly. "My guess is that since the new mana ranks were announced, the—"
"The mana ranks were posted three weeks ago." Irene's tone allowed no deviation.
Seb continued, steadier now. "Correct. And the week before, Clara had asked for help to find the children, but after the mana rank, she took it down because she couldn't pay for it. Nor was she classified anymore."
Irene's fingers curled against the desk. "Continue."
Marvenna picked up the thread, her low voice firm. "Clara is a nun. She spends her whole time trying to help children, teenagers, and adults in dangerous situations. Her mana is low. Not qualifiable. But she knows everything that happens in this city, in every dirty alley. Rei was very much adamant in keeping her as level one to let her have access to the board without payment and to have her as a consultant in some cases."
Irene drew a slow breath through her nose. "You're telling me this person knew what was happening?"
Seb shook his head quickly. "Clara has very low mana. She couldn't have known. But since she sees everything that happens, she probably noticed some kids missing."
Seraphine turned to Irene. "Didn't Anathema say some orphan kids were missing?"
"Probably?" Seb's hands twisted together. "Clara knows everything. I know she was searching for some kids that went missing, but since she lost the rank one classification, she was doing it alone. With some civilian help."
Irene pinched the bridge of her nose. "Why did nobody tell me that?"
Marvenna's expression never changed. "We did. It's all in Rei's report."

Marvenna reached beneath her desk and produced a thick leather-bound journal. She set it down with a solid thud that echoed through the quiet hall. Irene's eyes fixed on it.
"Rei kept records," Marvenna said. "Very detailed ones."
She opened the journal, pages worn from frequent handling. Irene leaned forward, scanning the neat script that filled each line. Names. Dates. Observations written in Rei's careful hand.
"Clara isn't the only one." Marvenna's finger traced down a list. "Rei refused to let go of several rank ones. People with low mana levels who possessed abilities she judged necessary."
Irene read silently. Her jaw tightened with each entry.
"Clara knew everything that happened in dirty alleys, with people society ignored." Marvenna turned a page. "Damion and his daughter Ann—hunters. They knew the western forest like the back of their hands. Could track anything, create traps, guide whoever needed it."
Seraphine moved closer, reading over Irene's shoulder. The entries continued, detailed and thorough.
"Teacher Celeste. Mana almost zero, but somehow made everyone around her calmer just by being near." Marvenna's tone remained flat, professional. "Cecil, the scholar. Knew mushrooms, roots, leaves, moss, and insects like they were old friends. A cook in midtown who could guess someone or something's favorite dish just by looking at them."
Irene's fingers gripped the journal's edge. "I never got any of this."
"Rei sent it to the capital." Marvenna met her gaze. "Many, many times. She wrote extensively in this book about people with zero mana who she believed could help lower the mortality rate of high-level adventurers."
The silence stretched.
Val turned sharply toward Seb. "You knew this was happening?"
Color crept up his neck. "I went to visit family when she posted it. I thought someone would pick it up. Maybe Ironjaw, Old Man Curtis, or Azael and—"
Seraphine's golden eyes narrowed. "I know Ironjaw could handle it, but the other two?"
Seb straightened slightly, defensive. "Old Man Curtis isn't official. Rei kept him as a level one because she could ask for him when needed. And Azael..." He paused. "Since she cares about the orphans in Clara's care, I thought—"
"She's a level one." Selene's eyebrow arched. "You, a level eight, thought a level one could handle a Child Eater?"
"I know it sounds weird." Seb ran a hand through his hair. "But her takes on spells and potion crafting are definitely strange and effective."
Marvenna nodded once. "I told you all before. If the people I love were in danger, I would choose Azael."
Seb glanced at Val, then back to the others. "I would choose Val in most cases. But in others, I would pick her too."
Seraphine opened her mouth. Closed it. The words felt ridiculous forming in her mind, yet after tonight they carried weight she couldn't ignore. "As weird as it sounds, I kind of agree."
Irene looked up from the report. Her expression was unreadable—serene surface over something churning beneath. "I want to know every single date Rei tried to send me something or tried to talk to me and I didn't reply. I want to know if I wasn't aware of any of this."
She turned pages, reading faster now. Entries spanned months. Years, even. Requests for consultation. Warnings about changes to the ranking system. Proposals for alternative evaluation metrics.
All ignored.
"When Rei returns, we will have a long talk about everything." Irene closed the journal carefully. "Also, Marvenna, I want the files from every one of these level ones. Everything. I want to understand what I didn't see. I want to understand what Rei saw."
Marvenna inclined her head. "Of course."
Irene pressed both palms flat against her desk again. Drew a breath. Released it slowly through her nose.
"Well." Her mouth curved slightly—wry, self-deprecating. "This is embarrassing."
Selene's shoulders shook. The chuckle started low, building until it broke free—genuine amusement cutting through the tension like a blade through silk.
Seraphine felt her own lips twitch despite everything. The absurdity of it settled over the room like dust after battle. A Hero. A Guildmaster. Elite specialists. All outperformed by a level one adventurer and her wooden companion while a ten-year-old boy guided them through darkness none of them could pierce.
Irene gathered the journal against her chest. "Dismissed. All of you. Get some rest."
They filed out slowly. Val and Seb first, whispering to each other. Ananas alone, spine still rigid with unspent pride. Selene lingered near the door, waiting for Seraphine.
Sera paused at the threshold. Looked back.
Irene stood framed by lamplight, head bowed over Rei's careful script. Reading what she should've seen months ago. 
"What did you see, Rei?" She whispered to herself 
The door closed with a soft click.

The bakery smelled like sugar and warmth. Tomé sat cross-legged on the bench, spoon gesturing wildly as he narrated their descent into darkness. His bowl of ice cream sat forgotten beside him, melting into soup.
"—and then the ceiling broke and there were like a million spiders, but they didn't fall on us because there was this invisible net—"
"Fifty spiders, maybe," Azael corrected around a mouthful of vanilla. "Not a million."
"A million sounds better." Tomé's eyes shone. "And then the ground opened up and we fell into this huge cave with all the cocoons—"
Bia pressed closer against her mother, Elena's arms wrapped tight around her shoulders. The girl's blonde hair hung clean now, freshly washed, but shadows still lingered beneath her eyes. She picked at her ice cream, strawberry turning pink around the edges.
"—and Miss Irene made wind to catch everyone, and Miss Lina had this flying thing, and then the monster came out and it was HUGE—" Tomé spread his arms wide, nearly knocking his bowl off the table. "Bigger than three houses!"
Azael caught the bowl before it tipped. "About that size, yeah."
"And Miss Hero's sword glowed gold and she jumped so high and cut its head clean off!" Tomé mimed the swing, complete with sound effects.
Bia's mouth curved slightly—first hint of a smile since they'd pulled her from the cocoon. She glanced at Azael, something mischievous flickering across her dirt-streaked face.
"Yeah, and I ran straight to Aza when I saw her." Bia's voice came quiet but sharp. "But she only had eyes for the hero."
Azael choked.
Ice cream went down wrong, lodging somewhere between throat and lungs. She coughed, sputtering, hand pressed against her chest while her face burned hot enough to melt steel.
Tomé nodded enthusiastically, oblivious to Azael's distress. "Well, Miss Hero was really nice and pretty. Her eyes were so gold and shiny, like treasure!"
Mirtha's grin spread slow and wicked across her weathered face. She set down the tray she'd been carrying, leaning against the counter with both hands. "Ohhh, what's that I hear? You have weak knees for pretty heroes?"
"I—no—that's not—" Azael's words tangled over themselves, stammering in a way that never happened, that shouldn't happen. Her threads coiled tight against her palms beneath the table, seeking something to grip that wasn't humiliation. "She just—the way she fought was—I mean, technically speaking—"
"Technically." Mirtha's eyes glinted with pure delight. "Is that what we're calling it now?"
Elena's soft laugh joined Mirtha's crueler one. Even Anathema's roots shifted—movement that might've been amusement if living wood could manage such things.
Bia's smile widened properly now, color returning to her cheeks. "You should've seen her face when Miss Hero landed on the invisible thing. Aza looked like—"
"Finish that sentence and you're grounded," Azael muttered.
"You can't ground me. You're not my mom."
"I saved your life tonight. That earns me grounding privileges."
Tomé bounced in his seat. "Miss Hero said thank you to Aza! And she smiled! It was really pretty!"
Mirtha pressed a hand to her chest, voice dripping false sympathy. "Oh, the poor girl. Felled by a smile. How devastating."
Azael shoved another spoonful of ice cream into her mouth to avoid responding. Her face still burned. Worse—her threads trembled slightly, betraying the embarrassment she couldn't quite suppress.
Bia leaned harder against her mother, some tension finally draining from her small frame. "Do you think Miss Hero would teach me sword fighting?"
"Absolutely not," Elena said immediately.
"But—"
"No swords. We talked about this."
Azael focused intently on her ice cream, willing the heat in her cheeks to fade. Golden eyes. Precise movements. That impossible synchronization with Anathema, like they'd trained together for years instead of minutes.
Mirtha's knowing gaze pinned her from across the room.
Azael looked away first.

Desire for Action
Chapter 3
Seraphine selects a quest for the missing caravan in the Red Forest at the guild hall with Marvenna's guidance. At Mirtha's bakery, Seraphine discusses displaced level ones with Elena, Mirtha, and Anathema, then convinces Azael to join despite her reluctance.
That afternoon, Seraphine prepares gear at the armory and dines with Lina and Sora at the tavern, where they analyze Azael's abilities and note Seraphine's fixation.
Next morning at the city's edge, Seraphine meets Azael and Anathema, then they visit Damion's cottage to recruit him and Ann amid tensions over guild changes.
The group proceeds toward the Red Forest, with Damion and Ann leading on terrain.

 
Chapter 2, Scene 2 (Continued)
The guild hall had shifted into its morning rhythm—boots on polished stone, the low hum of conversations, the smell of coffee and leather. Seraphine stood before the quest board, arms crossed, scanning the postings with methodical precision.
Marvenna appeared at her shoulder, silent as always.
"Looking for something specific?"
Seraphine didn't turn. "Something Rei would choose."
"To drag Azael with her?"
"Exactly."
Marvenna's mouth curved. "That's easy, then."
She reached past Seraphine and plucked a posting from the lower corner—paper yellowed at the edges, the ink slightly faded. Seraphine took it, frown deepening as she read.
Caravan disappeared near Red Forest. Last contact three weeks ago. Reward dependent on recovery of goods and survivors.
"Why isn't this on the Specialist board?"
Marvenna shrugged. "Not enough money."
Seraphine's jaw tightened. The Red Forest sat up north, a sprawling anomaly where reality bent wrong. Trees moved. Paths vanished. People who entered rarely came back the same—if they came back at all. The kind of place that required experience, preparation, a team that knew how to read danger before it arrived.
The kind of place a Hero should handle.
"I'm taking it."
Marvenna's eyebrow lifted. "You sure? The Red Forest is—"
"I know what it is." Seraphine pulled the posting from the board. "Where does Azael live?"
"Mirtha's bakery. Tower attached to the back."
"Got it."
The bakery smelled like sugar and butter, warmth rolling through the open door in waves that made Seraphine's stomach twist with something close to nostalgia. She stepped inside, gaze tracking the space—display cases lined with pastries, flour dusting every surface, morning light streaming through fogged windows.
Two kids stood near the counter, hands covered in frosting, voices rising in heated debate.
"No, Tomé, the flowers go on the sides, not the top!"
"But it looks prettier on top!"
"It looks stupid!"
"You're stupid!"
An older woman leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching the argument with barely concealed amusement. Beside her stood a younger woman—maybe mid-thirties, dark hair pulled back, exhaustion written across her face in fine lines.
Both turned when Seraphine entered.
The old woman's grin widened. "Well, well. Aren't you fancy."
Seraphine pushed her sunglasses up into her hair. "I'm looking for Azael."
The two women exchanged glances. Mirtha's expression shifted into something warmer, knowing.
"Oh, she didn't wake up yet." Mirtha gestured toward the back. "The kids run to her when Anathema comes in for the morning tea."
Seraphine blinked. "Tea?"
No Doll or Golem drank tea. Neither possessed the physiology for consumption—no digestive tract, no need for sustenance, no ability to process liquid beyond hydraulic functions.
The door opened.
Anathema ducked through the frame, massive and silent, morning light catching on his bark. His roots shifted in their sockets, turning toward Seraphine.
"I came for the new tea blends." His voice rumbled low, polite. "Oh. Hello, hero."
Elena—the younger woman—gestured toward the back. "They're looking for Azael."
Anathema's head tilted slightly. "Ah. She's got bad mood in the morning. Are you sure?"
Before Seraphine could respond, small hands grabbed her sleeve. She looked down. Bia and Tomé stared up at her, frosting-streaked and determined.
"You have to tell us," Tomé said, "which one is better."
They dragged her toward the counter. Seraphine let herself be pulled, gaze tracking between two cake attempts—one covered in lopsided flowers, the other sporting a geometric pattern that might've been stars.
"Well?" Bia crossed her arms.
Seraphine studied both cakes. "The flowers have charm, but the pattern shows better technique."
Both kids groaned and immediately resumed arguing.
Seraphine turned back toward the adults and the wooden figure discussing tea varieties like they had all morning.
"How's Bia doing?" The question slipped out before she could stop it.
Elena's expression softened. "She had nightmares one day. But then she was sleeping soundly."
"We threatened whatever could come near Bia's room," Anathema said. "Now she's safe."
Elena's eyes lit up. Mirtha's smile turned gentle, genuine. Seraphine's chest tightened.
"That's... good." She paused. "The past Level Ones—the ones who can't be adventurers anymore because of the new rules. Do you know what happened to them?"
Mirtha's warmth faded slightly. Elena looked away.
"Some found other work," Mirtha said carefully. "Others are struggling."
"Clara lost her classification," Elena added quietly. "She can't post quests anymore. Can't afford the fees."
Seraphine's jaw clenched. She'd read the reports—knew the new mana requirements had displaced dozens of low-level adventurers. Knew Irene intended to address it eventually, once the guild stabilized. But eventually didn't help people now.
Footsteps thundered down stairs somewhere in the back. The door burst open.
"IT'S AZA'S HERO!"
Tomé's voice carried enough volume to rattle the display cases. Seraphine's face burned.
"I'm not—that's not—"
Azael appeared in the doorway, hair disheveled, still wearing sleep clothes, eyes narrowed against the morning light. She spotted Seraphine and froze.
Their gazes locked.
Seraphine's stomach dropped again—that same sensation from the arena, like stepping on ground that wasn't solid. Azael's eyes caught the light wrong, too blue, too bright.
"Oh." Azael's voice came rough with sleep. "The hero."
The silk robe hung loose on Azael's frame, dark fabric pooling at her waist, neckline plunging deep enough to make Seraphine's gaze snap to the ceiling. She held an empty mug in one hand, the other braced against the doorframe.
Elena moved without prompting, lifting a coffee pot from the counter and crossing to fill Azael's mug. The scent of dark roast cut through the sugar-sweet air.
Azael took a long sip, then blinked at Seraphine over the rim. "Aren't you a bit far from the guild?"
"I actually came after you." Seraphine locked her eyes on Azael's face—on the sharp line of her jaw, the ink patterns crawling up her neck. Anywhere but down. "Can we talk?"
"It's too early for that." Azael took another drink. "Also, hero, my face is up here."
Elena and Mirtha burst into laughter. Heat flooded Seraphine's cheeks.
"I wasn't looking, dammit!" Her voice pitched higher than intended. "Can we talk or not?"
Azael groaned, head tipping back. "But I don't wanna. I already took the two missions I needed."
"She is searching Rei's level ones," Anathema rumbled.
Seraphine's shoulders loosened. "I would never question the Guild Leader, but she may have been too blind in her assessment."
Azael's eyebrow lifted. She drank her coffee.
Seraphine pressed forward. "The runaway children—were they among the ones you found?"
Anathema's roots shifted in their sockets. "Yes. Clara was very happy when we returned them."
"That's good." Seraphine's chest tightened. "Good that she cares so much about the children. Despite everything with the guild."
Mirtha snorted. "She didn't care about the guild that much. But Rei was adamant she have access to the board." Her smile gentled. "Some people are truly just wanting to help, you know?"
The words landed heavier than Seraphine expected. She pulled the quest posting from her pocket, smoothed it against her thigh.
"I've got a mission. Red Forest. But I'm hesitant—I don't know much about the geography up there." She glanced at Mirtha. "Does Clara perhaps know more?"
Elena laughed, sharp and genuine. "That woman knows people and this shitty city's holes. If you want to go inside the forest, you need hunters."
"We like Damion the most." Anathema's voice carried warmth. "He and Ann stopped us from getting lost many times."
Mirtha grinned. "Oh, and we know your owner can't follow a map for the life of her."
"True." Anathema's head tilted toward Azael. "But she gets mad if you say that to her face."
Azael glared at him over her coffee mug.
Elena leaned against the counter. "Damion always gets the biggest animals. The tavern I work for adores when he shows up with fresh hunt."
"Who doesn't?" Mirtha wiped flour from her hands. "That man can track and hunt anything that moves. His kid's not far behind."
Seraphine's pulse quickened. "Where can I find him?"
"Going on missions with people not enrolled in the guild is a violation of the code," Anathema said.
Seraphine's jaw clenched. "That's why Rei made them level one."
Silence fell across the bakery. Anathema's roots stilled. Mirtha's expression shifted into something knowing, approving.
"Ah." Anathema straightened. "You're searching Rei's level ones."
Seraphine's mouth curved despite herself, sheepish and determined all at once. "I would never question the Guild Leader. But she may have been too blind in her assessment."
Azael lowered her mug. Their eyes met again—that same pull, that same sensation of ground shifting beneath Seraphine's feet.
"Clever hero," Azael murmured.

Seraphine folded the posting and tucked it back into her pocket. "I'm trying to understand Rei better, too. How she worked, who she trusted." She paused. "Marvenna suggested I take you on the mission."
Azael's head dropped against the doorframe with a dull thunk. "But I don't wanna." The whine that came out of her mouth belonged to a child denied dessert, not a woman whose mana burned constant and impossible. "I hate that place. It's confusing. Everything looks the same. Trees, trees, more trees, then suddenly the trees are behind you and you're walking in circles."
"You can take a map," Mirtha offered.
Azael's eyes narrowed. "Don't start, old lady."
Seraphine squared her shoulders. "I'm trying to prove a point to the Guild Leader. I would be happy to have your help."
Azael lifted her mug, took a long, deliberate sip. Her gaze drifted to Seraphine over the ceramic rim—lazy, appraising. "Why me?" The corner of her mouth curled. "So you can look at my cleavage for longer?"
Elena doubled over. Mirtha wheezed. Even Anathema's bark creaked in what might have been amusement. Seraphine's face went scarlet from jaw to hairline, hands balling into fists at her sides.
"Because that's what Rei would do!" The words came out strangled, too loud. She forced her voice down. "She'd bring people who knew the terrain, people the guild overlooked. Can you help me or not?"
Azael swirled her coffee, noncommittal. The silence stretched. She opened her mouth—
"She will help you." Mirtha's voice cut through the bakery like a cleaver through dough. "Or she won't have my cooking anytime soon."
Azael's mug froze mid-air. Her lips parted. Something close to genuine horror crossed her face.
"You wouldn't."
"I would." Mirtha didn't blink. "No stew. No bread. No roast. And I'll tell Elena to cut off the iced coffee."
Elena raised both hands. "I'm already on board."
Azael stared at Mirtha. Stared at Elena. Stared into her mug like it held the last comfort she'd ever know. Her shoulders sagged.
She looked at Seraphine.
"Fine." She drained the rest of her coffee in one long pull. "But you're buying me beer after."
Seraphine spent the afternoon at the guild armory, checking straps, sharpening her blade, inventorying supplies she'd packed a hundred times before. Her hands moved through the routine on muscle memory while her mind circled the same thought—why am I nervous?
She'd cleared bandit camps at fifteen. Fought a drake at seventeen. Led a squad through the Ashlands with two broken ribs and half a plan. Missions were breathing. Missions were the one thing that never made her palms sweat.
She tightened a buckle on her pack and loosened it again.

"You seem jumpy."
Lina sat across from her at the tavern, chin propped on her fist, dark eyes bright with amusement. Between them, plates of roasted chicken and root vegetables crowded the scarred wood table.
Seraphine exhaled through her teeth. "Tell me about it. I'm jumpy. It's just a dumb mission."
Sora, seated beside Lina, cut a raw carrot into precise discs with surgical focus. "It's the first time in a long while you'll go with someone unknown."
Seraphine pointed her fork at Sora. "I bet that's it."
Lina didn't look convinced. She tilted her head, ponytail swinging. "You want us to come with you?"
"No. No need. You two should rest and help Irene settle in, or she's going to freeze someone."
Lina's laugh rang bright across the tavern. Sora crunched a carrot disc. "What do you expect to find?"
Seraphine sighed, pushing chicken around her plate. "No idea, honestly. Nothing about her makes sense. If she really controls that net that protected us—how does her mana not fluctuate? Not even a ripple."
Sora nodded, gray eyes distant with calculation. Lina leaned back in her chair, arms folded.
"What if it's not magic?"
Seraphine looked up. "You mean like you? With your tools?"
"It's an explanation, right?" Lina spread her hands. "Mechanical tension systems, wire composites—there are ways to mimic containment fields without mana expenditure."
Sora's mouth pressed thin. She didn't seem sold.
Lina's gaze slid sideways, casual as a cat stretching. "Also, Sera—did you notice the pretty bartender throwing eyes at you?"
Sora glanced toward the bar and back. "I was wondering why you haven't gone over there yet."
Seraphine barely turned her head. The bartender stood polishing glasses near the tap—tall, auburn hair, the kind of easy smile that promised uncomplicated things. "Oh, she is?" Her fork scraped the plate. "Also—how would you do it? That net? Can you think of something? I mean, your tools went a bit wonky in the forest, but her net held perfectly stable. Is that even possible with mechanical systems in a high-interference zone?"
Lina and Sora looked at each other.
The glance held weight. Seraphine didn't notice. She'd torn a piece of bread apart and was arranging the fragments on the table like she could map the net's geometry from memory.
This was wrong. Not wrong-dangerous—wrong-strange. Seraphine collected people the way storms collected debris. She touched shoulders when she talked, held eye contact a beat too long, leaned into warmth like a creature starved for it. Physical attention was her language, her anchor, the thing she reached for when the world went sideways. She craved the weight of another body beside hers, fingers tangled in hers, the simple proof that someone chose to stay close. Years of loving someone who flinched at closeness had left her raw with it—hungry in a way that embarrassed her if she thought too long. So she didn't think. She flirted. She followed pretty smiles into dim corners and took whatever heat was offered, because the alternative was standing still with her hands empty.
Lina and Sora had spent years nudging her toward exactly this—a lovely stranger with willing eyes—and Seraphine had never resisted much. A grin, a tilt of her chin, and she'd be at the bar buying drinks before Lina finished her sentence.
But now Seraphine was rearranging bread crumbs and muttering about tensile strength.
Lina kicked Sora's ankle under the table. Sora's carrot froze mid-bite.
"The bartender has really nice arms," Lina tried.
"Mm." Seraphine frowned at her bread map. "What if the threads are organic? Like spider silk but reinforced—no, that still wouldn't explain the mana signature being zero—"
"She's been looking over here for ten minutes."
"—unless the material itself is the conduit and she's not casting at all, she's just directing—"
Lina sat back. Sora set her carrot down.
They watched Seraphine pick apart a chicken thigh with the same intensity she usually reserved for a sparring match, golden eyes burning holes through the table, completely and utterly elsewhere.
Lina mouthed: the Level One.
Sora's lips pressed together. She gave one slow, deliberate nod.
Lina and Sora looked at each other.
The silence between them stretched thick with unsaid things. Lina's mind ticked through a catalogue of pretty faces Seraphine had chased with the single-minded focus of a hunting dog on a scent—the merchant's daughter in Clearwater, all curves and dimples, who'd laughed at every terrible joke Sera told. The female orc at the border garrison, muscles like carved stone, who'd arm-wrestled Sera into breathless defeat and then into her tent. The bard with the silver tongue who'd sung ballads directly into Sera's ear until the hero went pink from neck to hairline.
Then there were the twins in Ashford. Lina still wasn't entirely sure what had happened there, only that Seraphine had emerged from that inn room looking dazed and satisfied in equal measure.
And—gods—the naga. The naga. The one who'd cornered them in the marsh with murder in her eyes and venom dripping from her fangs, and Seraphine had somehow turned a death threat into an invitation for drinks. Lina had watched, slack-jawed, as Sera leaned against a tree and asked if the naga's scales were as soft as they looked, voice dropping into that low, rough register that made people forget how to think straight.
The naga had forgotten she wanted to kill them. They'd left the marsh alive, and Seraphine had left with a very detailed understanding of naga anatomy.
Seraphine collected touch the way some people collected scars—proof of survival, proof of being wanted, proof she could reach out and find something warm that didn't pull away.
And now she sat across from a bartender who looked like every other person Sera had ever dragged into a quiet corner, and Seraphine was solving equations with bread crumbs.
Lina kicked Sora's ankle again. Harder.
Sora's gaze flicked to her. Back to Seraphine. Back to Lina.
They'd spent years watching this pattern—the restless energy, the hungry eyes, the way Sera gravitated toward anyone offering warmth like a moth to an open flame. She didn't even pretend to be subtle about it. She enjoyed the chase, the heat, the simple uncomplicated proof that someone wanted her back.
Except now.
Now, Seraphine was muttering about mana conduits and staring at the table like it held the secrets of the universe.
Lina leaned forward, elbows on wood. "She's smiling really pretty."
Sora nodded slowly. "Really pretty."
Seraphine's frown deepened. She looked up, golden eyes sharp with frustration. "Can you two help me? I'm really confused."
About the net. About Azael. Not about the bartender she hadn't glanced at twice.
Lina and Sora exchanged another look—this one longer, weighted with the kind of understanding that came from years fighting side by side. Sora's mouth curved, barely. Lina's grin threatened to split her face.
Sora set her carrot down with deliberate precision. "Well, you're going with her tomorrow, right?" Her voice stayed level, clinical. "Pay attention to your surroundings."
"Watch how she moves through the forest," Lina added, warming to the task. "Whether she tracks by sight or sound. If she hesitates at intersections or takes paths without checking landmarks."
"Note what tools she carries." Sora ticked points off on her fingers. "How she packs her supplies. Whether she checks them obsessively or trusts her preparation."
"Does she eat during travel or wait for camp?" Lina's grin sharpened. "Some people get cranky when their blood sugar drops. Good to know before you're knee-deep in hostile territory."
"Observe her combat stance if you encounter anything dangerous." Sora's gray eyes glinted. "Dominant hand, defensive reflexes, whether she leads or follows instinctively."
"And talk to her." Lina spread her hands. "Just... talk. Ask questions. People reveal themselves when they think the conversation's casual."
Seraphine's shoulders relaxed fraction by fraction. She nodded, tension bleeding from her jaw. "That's good. That's smart." She looked between them, something grateful flickering across her face. "You're right. I need to gather information before I make any conclusions."
"Exactly." Lina's smile could've cut glass.
Sora crunched another carrot, gaze distant.
Seraphine returned to her chicken, energy shifting from frantic to focused. She ate with purpose now, fueling up for tomorrow, mind already three steps ahead into the Red Forest.
The bartender polished another glass. Waited.
Seraphine never looked up.
The meeting point sat at the city's eastern edge, where cobblestone gave way to packed dirt and the buildings thinned to scattered cottages. Seraphine arrived as dawn broke, sky still bruised purple, frost glittering on the ground.
Too early. She knew it was too early. But her room had felt like a cage—walls pressing in, bedsheets tangled from restless sleep, her mind spinning through scenarios until she'd given up and dressed in the dark.
She paced. Checked her pack. Rechecked it. Tightened straps that didn't need tightening.
Footsteps approached from the west—one set heavy enough to rattle loose stones, the other nearly silent.
Anathema emerged first from the morning shadows, massive and unhurried. Behind him, Azael yawned wide enough to crack her jaw, dark hair pulled back, sunglasses already in place despite the weak light.
Seraphine's gaze dropped—automatic, involuntary—and stopped short.
Azael's coat buttoned to her throat. Every single clasp fastened, collar high, not an inch of skin visible below her jawline.
Azael's mouth curved sharp and satisfied. "Now I'm fully protected from your naughty intentions."
Heat flooded Seraphine's face. "I don't have—that's not—"
"Sure, hero." Azael stretched, coat pulling tight across her shoulders. "Whatever helps you sleep."
Seraphine's jaw clenched. "You're the one who keeps bringing it up."
"Because your eyes keep going down."
"They do not!"
Anathema stood between them, roots shifting in their sockets, waiting with the patience of stone. The silence stretched. Seraphine exhaled hard through her nose.
"Let's go." She adjusted her pack with more force than necessary. "The mission has little information, so we'll have to be creative."
Azael nodded, yawn fading into focus. "Well, let's go after Damion then."
Seraphine paused mid-step. "Isn't that against the rules?"
"It's against the rules to take a non-adventurer on a mission." Azael's smile sharpened. "However, there's nothing about tagging along with a hunter doing their everyday job and by coincidence handling a quest."
The logic clicked into place—clean, elegant, completely sidestepping guild regulations without technically breaking them. Seraphine's mouth curved slow, something warm unfurling in her chest.
"You're dangerous, you know?"
"So is my cleavage." Azael gestured at her fully-buttoned coat. "So eyes up, hero."
Seraphine's face went scarlet again. She turned sharply east and started walking before her mouth could make things worse.

Damion's cottage sat far from the city center, tucked where farmland met forest edge. The path wound through fields gone fallow for winter, frost crunching under their boots.
Anathema walked point, his bulk casting long shadows in the early light. Azael followed several paces back, hands in her pockets, occasionally glancing around with the lost expression of someone who'd never seen this road before in her life.
"Are we going the right way?" Azael squinted at a fence post.
"Yes," Anathema rumbled.
Ten minutes later: "This doesn't look familiar."
"We're on the right path."
Another five minutes: "I think we passed that tree already."
"We did not."
Seraphine glanced between them, confusion pulling her brows together. Anathema's roots turned slightly in her direction.
"She has a bad sense of direction."
"I do not." Azael's voice came flat, defensive.
"Of course you don't." Anathema's tone stayed perfectly level. "You get lost because you want to."
"I don't get lost." Azael gestured broadly at the landscape. "The world around me changes, that's all."
Seraphine's laugh burst out before she could stop it—bright and genuine, startling a crow from a nearby branch. "That's a creative way of saying 'I get lost often.'"
Azael's head swiveled toward her. Even through the sunglasses, Seraphine felt the weight of that stare.
"You're talking too much for someone who can't look at my face."
Seraphine's jaw dropped. "I'm looking at your face right now!"
"Then drop it."
"Drop what?!"
"The whole 'I wasn't staring' act." Azael's smile curled wicked. "Get used to it, hero."
Seraphine opened her mouth. Closed it. Opened it again. No words came.
Anathema continued walking, unbothered, morning light catching on his bark. Behind him, Seraphine's face burned hot enough to melt the frost, and Azael hummed something tuneless, hands still in her pockets, looking entirely too pleased with herself.

The knife scraped against the whetstone in long, methodical strokes—a sound that raised the hairs on the back of Seraphine's neck. Damion sat on his porch, weathered hands working the blade with the ease of decades, gray threading through his dark hair. He looked up without surprise or interest, gaze tracking past Azael to Anathema and settling there.
Anathema stopped several paces back. Azael pushed forward, hands still in her pockets, smile easy.
"So, how are you doing, mr hunter man?"
Damion's mouth twitched. The knife stilled. "Shut up. What are you doing here? Did you get lost trying to get to the tavern?"
"That was mean."
He set the whetstone aside, smirk sharpening. "For real, or are you finally confessing to me?"
Seraphine's jaw clenched. Her fingers curled against her palm, nails biting skin.
Azael's laugh rang bright across the clearing. "Again, that was mean. And no, you're too old for me."
Damion's laughter boomed, loud enough to rattle the shutters. He wiped his eyes, grin splitting his face. "What do you two need?"
Azael glanced back. Seraphine stepped forward, shoulders squared.
"I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Seraphine from the capital."
The warmth drained from Damion's expression. His gaze raked over her—boots to hairline, cataloguing. "Ah. The pet of the new guild leader." The knife resumed its scraping, slower. "How did throwing us all out feel?"
The words landed clean, precise. No anger. Just fact.
Seraphine's throat tightened. "Not good at all."
"Good." Damion tested the blade's edge with his thumb. "I don't care about that at all. But Clara was essential." His eyes lifted, sharper than the steel in his hand. "Also, I'm getting old. Ann may not be as forgiving."
"I can totally understand that."
The scraping stopped. Damion studied her face—searching for mockery, for platitudes, for whatever nobles usually offered when confronted with consequences. Whatever he found made his shoulders loosen, fraction by fraction.
"It's against the rules to take a non-adventurer on a quest."
Azael's smile curved wicked. "We won't take you with us, obviously. You'll just be near. Coincidentally."
Seraphine watched the exchange—the easy rhythm of it, the way Damion's smirk softened around the edges when Azael spoke, the casual intimacy of old jokes worn smooth with repetition. Something hot and uncomfortable twisted behind her ribs.
She didn't recognize it at first. The sensation felt foreign, wrong, like trying on armor that didn't fit. Then Azael tilted her head, sunlight catching on the ink crawling up her throat, and Damion chuckled low in his chest, and Seraphine's stomach dropped.
Jealousy.
The realization hit like cold water.
She had no right to it. No claim. Azael was a stranger—an infuriating, button-pushing, cleavage-flaunting stranger who'd done nothing but tease her since they'd met. The flirting meant nothing. Azael probably talked to everyone like that. Probably had a hundred Damions scattered across the West, people who knew her well enough to laugh at her jokes, to offer casual confessions and rejections in the same breath.
It meant nothing.
So why did Seraphine's jaw ache from clenching?
Damion rose, knife in hand, movements economical. "What's the job?"
"Red Forest." Seraphine forced her voice steady. "Caravan went missing three weeks ago. Last contact was near the eastern edge."
"Three weeks?" Damion's brows drew together. "That's deep. The forest shifts daily—paths close, landmarks move. You're not finding tracks."
"I know." Seraphine met his gaze. "I need someone who knows the terrain. Who can read the forest even when it's lying."
Silence stretched. Damion looked at Azael. Back to Seraphine. His mouth curved, slow and considering.
"Ann's gonna love this."
"Is she here?"
"Hunting." Damion jerked his chin toward the tree line. "Should be back soon." He crossed to the porch railing, propped one boot on the lowest slat. "So. Capital pet and the lost wanderer. What's the real reason you're out here?"
Azael turned, sunglasses reflecting the morning light. "Well?" Her head tilted toward Seraphine. "You're the boss here."
The words settled wrong—formal where everything else between them stayed sharp and teasing. Seraphine swallowed against the bitter taste coating her tongue, forced her shoulders back.
"I don't know the geography. I'm uncomfortable going in blind."
Damion's laughter exploded across the clearing—loud enough to scatter birds from the nearby trees. He doubled over, one hand braced on his knee, knife dangling forgotten from the other.
"You're insecure about geography—" He gasped for air. "—and you went after the one person who'd get lost in her own home?"
Azael's gasp rang theatrical, hand pressed to her chest. "I resent that."
"The kids glued arrows on the walls," Anathema rumbled, "to make sure she wouldn't get lost."
Damion's laughter redoubled. He wiped his eyes, shoulders shaking. "Those little shits crack me up every time." He straightened, grin still splitting his face. "Fine. Fine."
He stood, testing the knife's balance in his palm, gaze settling on Seraphine. "I'll help. But only because I don't want Rei or Mirtha angry at me when this one here can't find her way back."
The words should've lightened the mood. Should've pulled a smile from Seraphine, easy camaraderie between strangers becoming allies.
Nothing came.
Annoyance prickled along her spine—hot and irrational and impossible to shake. At Damion's easy familiarity with Azael. At the arrows on the walls she hadn't seen. At the way everyone else seemed to know Azael's rhythms, her patterns, the shape of her humor, while Seraphine fumbled through conversations like walking unmarked terrain in the dark.
She forced her jaw to unclench. "I thank you immensely. I'm trying to prove something to the guild leader."
Damion's smirk sharpened. "Prove that Rei was right?" He slid the knife into its sheath with practiced ease. "Heh. Easiest thing ever." He turned toward the cottage, pulled a crystal communicator from his belt. "Let me call Ann back. But I want you to handle her. She's pissed at the guild."
The crystal flared blue-white in his palm, magic humming through the air.
Azael groaned, head tipping back toward the sky. "Ahh, a pissy teenager. Are you regretful already, hero?"
"Think of it as training," Anathema offered. His roots shifted in their sockets, turning toward Azael. "For when Bia gets there."
Azael paled. The color drained from her face so fast Seraphine might've laughed under different circumstances. "Oh dear." Her voice dropped flat. "None of us are ready for that." She gestured toward Damion. "You can just send her here. Mister hunter is used to it."
Damion set the communicator down, magic fading. "No thanks. I'm done for this life with teenagers."
"But you raised one," Azael protested.
"Exactly." Damion crossed his arms. "Why do you think I'm done?"
Seraphine's mouth twitched despite herself—the first crack in the tension coiled tight behind her ribs. Azael caught it, gaze tracking to Seraphine's face even through the sunglasses.
Their eyes met.
The world narrowed again—that same pull, that same sensation of stepping on ground that wasn't solid. Azael's smile curved slow, knowing.
"There she is."
Heat flooded Seraphine's cheeks. She looked away first, jaw clenching against words she couldn't name.
Footsteps approached from the tree line—light, fast, accompanied by the rustle of disturbed undergrowth.
Damion straightened. "That'll be Ann."
The girl who emerged from the tree line moved with the careless confidence of someone who knew the forest better than her own reflection. Dark hair tied back, bow slung across her shoulders, chin already lifted in challenge before she'd fully cleared the underbrush.
Ann's gaze locked on Seraphine. Her mouth twisted.
Azael took two deliberate steps backward, hands finding Seraphine's shoulders. She pushed—gentle but firm, propelling Seraphine forward like a shield.
"You're the hero who protects the weakest." Azael's voice stayed cheerful, bright with false innocence. "And that's me."
Damion retreated as well, boots scraping gravel. He crossed his arms, expression settling into something between amusement and resignation. "Don't take it personal. Teenager hormones."
Ann's gaze raked over Seraphine's armor—polished steel, guild insignia gleaming at the shoulder, the kind of equipment that cost more than most families earned in a year. Her lip curled.
"Oh. I thought we didn't have enough mana for your people." Each word dripped venom. "If you get lost, just use a spell or whatever you people do." She swung toward Damion. "What am I doing here?"
Seraphine straightened, jaw tight. "I understand you're angry, but—"
"Angry?" Ann's laugh came sharp. "Why would I be angry? Just because the guild decided my dad wasn't good enough anymore? Just because Clara can't post jobs, can't help the kids she's been protecting for years?" She stepped closer. "Just because people who've kept this shithole running got thrown out so capital pets like you could feel important?"
"That's not—"
"Save it." Ann's hands clenched. "I don't care what excuses—"
"Your father raised you better than that."
Azael's voice cut clean through Ann's tirade. Not loud. Not harsh. Just flat, matter-of-fact, carrying the weight of someone who'd watched Damion's work for years.
Ann froze mid-breath.
Damion's mouth curved. "I sure did." He jerked his chin toward the cottage. "Pack your stuff. We're going."
Ann's jaw worked. Color flooded her cheeks—embarrassment mixing with fury, the volatile combination of being called out by someone she couldn't dismiss. She spun on her heel and stalked toward the cottage, shoulders rigid.
Azael turned to Seraphine, hands still in her pockets. "When I said to protect me, I didn't mean you have to take all that."
Seraphine exhaled hard, tension bleeding from her shoulders. "Well." Her voice came quiet. "She isn't wrong. We messed up something that was working."
The admission tasted bitter. True, but bitter. Rei's network had functioned for years—imperfect, overlooked, but functional. Then the capital arrived with their regulations and mana requirements, and everything collapsed like a house built on sand.
Azael studied her face. Even through the sunglasses, Seraphine felt the weight of that gaze.
"Now you're trying to fix it." Azael's tone gentled, just slightly. "Cheer up, hero." Her smile curved wicked. "Do you want me to unfasten a couple buttons to make you happy?"
Heat flooded Seraphine's face. "You will never drop it, right?"
"Never." Azael's smirk sharpened.
The cottage door banged open. Ann emerged with a pack slung over one shoulder, bow in hand, expression still thunderous. She didn't look at Seraphine. Didn't acknowledge anyone except Damion.
"Ready."
Damion clapped her shoulder. "Good girl." He turned to Seraphine, something serious settling over his weathered features. "The Red Forest doesn't forgive mistakes. You follow our lead on terrain, we follow yours on combat. Clear?"
Seraphine nodded. "Clear."
"Then let's move before the paths shift again."
They headed east, where farmland gave way to wilderness and the tree line rose dark against the morning sky. Anathema walked point, massive and steady. Damion and Ann flanked them, father and daughter moving with identical economy of motion.
Azael stayed close to Seraphine, hands in pockets, gaze wandering everywhere except the path ahead.
The Red Forest waited.

Chapter 4
Damion instructs the group to follow single file into the Red Forest, warning of Fae territory dangers that twist reality. Ann complains about guild regulations forcing inexperienced escorts. They camp at the entrance until dawn. Seraphine questions Azael about her low mana and Anathema's origins; Azael explains Anathema as a protective gift from her guardian, attributes her luck to divine favor, and reveals Ann's rudeness stems from her recent mother's death. Anathema, Damion, and Ann return with foraged food and game.

Damion scanned the group, expression settling into the no-nonsense authority of someone who'd guided fools through worse. "This is how it goes. You follow me. No wandering." His gaze locked on Azael. "And yes, I'm talking to you, Pretty Eyes."
Azael's head snapped up. "Why am I being attacked for free everywhere?"
Ann snorted, the sound sharp with barely-suppressed amusement.
Damion didn't smile. "The Red Forest is a mess. We walk single file. Watch where you step." He jerked his chin toward the dark tree line. "Every step matters."
Seraphine shifted, hand resting on her sword pommel. "What exactly is the biggest danger there?"
Ann's eyes rolled hard enough to strain.
Damion exhaled through his nose. "Everything and more. That place is..." He gestured vaguely, mouth working around words that wouldn't come. "Ah, explain it better, Wise Tree."
Anathema tilted his head, roots shifting in empty sockets. "Fae territory."
The words dropped like stones into still water.
Seraphine's stomach clenched. "Fae? So they twist reality around the whole forest?"
"That's the beauty of it." Azael's voice curved with dark amusement. "You can walk through your entire life and never see anything weird. Or you can roam into a strange realm and never return."
"Very fun."
Damion's weathered face creased. "Many years ago, hunters and collectors built what we considered a safe path. Until recently, best practice was hiring someone to guide you through—someone who could see the signs when something went wrong, but..."
Ann's glare snapped to Seraphine like a whip crack. "But the guild said all escort duties should be done only by adventurers. And they're either too expensive or they know jack shit about the forest."
The words hit harder than Seraphine expected. She'd known the regulations caused problems—Rei's network collapsing proved that—but this ran deeper. Fae territories required expertise that couldn't be measured in mana levels or guild ranks. Even seasoned veterans thought twice before entering those twisted spaces.
Marvenna had given her this mission. A mission Rei would probably have dragged Azael into regardless.
Seraphine's jaw tightened. "Understood."

The Red Forest entrance loomed as the afternoon light slanted gold through ordinary trees. Nothing marked it as special—just a subtle shift in the quality of shadows, the way sound seemed to bend wrong.
Damion surveyed the fading sun. "We stop here. Start fresh at dawn."
They settled camp with practiced efficiency. Damion gestured Ann toward the perimeter. "Scout around. Set alarms if anything gets close."
Ann nodded, already moving.
Damion turned to Anathema. "Go see if you find anything edible." He patted his pack. "We've got rations, but better to keep them stocked."
"I will track something." Damion's bow appeared in his hands like he'd conjured it.
Seraphine and Azael stood alone in the clearing.
Seraphine exhaled. "She wasn't rude to me once. I think I'm making progress."
Azael's laugh came low and genuine. "You didn't see her glaring at you? Bless your heart."
"I kind of ignored it." Seraphine began unrolling her bedding. "Hoped it was at you because you kept flirting with her father."
Azael dropped onto her bedroll with theatrical grace, stretching out like a cat in sunlight. "Jealous already, hero?" Her smile curved wicked. "You didn't even see my legs."
Heat crawled up Seraphine's neck. "I'm not—"
"Sure."

Seraphine settled onto her bedroll, angling herself to face Azael directly. The woman sprawled like she owned the ground beneath her, dark hair spilling across rough fabric. "I have to look at you to see if I can finally understand."
Azael's head tilted, sunglasses catching the dying light. "Understand what?"
"..." Seraphine's jaw worked. "You."
"Why?" Azael's smile curved lazy. "I'm very simple to understand. Wait, are you confessing to me already?"
Heat flooded Seraphine's face. "You don't make sense. Your mana doesn't make sense. Anathema doesn't make sense."
Azael blinked slowly, the motion deliberate. "Oh. I thought you just wanted to see my boobs."
"Be serious."
"I'm very serious. They're great, by the way."
Seraphine's gaze dropped—just a fraction, just a heartbeat—then snapped back up.
Azael smirked. "That's all then? My mana is low, that's all. Very usual. And Anathema..."
"He should suck all your mana off."
"That would be true if he fed from me at all."
Seraphine straightened. "Isn't he yours?"
"Yes, but I'm not the one who made him. It was a gift actually." Azael stretched, joints popping. "The woman who raised me gave him to me. To protect me. That's all."
"You told Rei that?"
"Multiple times. She's skeptical and dumb. Don't be like her."
"And she just..." Seraphine gestured vaguely. "This person just feeds him? She doesn't miss the mana?"
Azael yawned, jaw cracking wide. "It's not like I'm an adventurer, hero. And it was a gift... I didn't question it. You see, I have the bad habit of getting in trouble. Wouldn't you try to help someone you raised if you could?"
The logic tracked, but something underneath it didn't quite settle right. Seraphine's fingers drummed against her knee.
"The woman who raised me told me I was excellent at avoiding wasting my energy. Maybe that's what she means." Azael rolled onto her side, propping her head on one hand. "Plus, all your fancy tools are supposed to catch minimum fluctuation values. I'm just too low for that. The reason you think I'm different is that you saw Anathema and you made assumptions. But I bet that every level one would be low too... especially if they didn't fight themselves."
"Marvenna said Rei takes you on missions."
"Maybe we're having an affair?"
Seraphine sighed. "Seriously now?"
"Will you get jealous over Rei too? Please do. It's adorable."
"Nobody called my jealousy adorable before. Annoying, yes. But adorable?"
Azael's grin sharpened. "So you admit it's jealousy?"
"Shut up. Just answer me."
"I'm lucky, that's all. Beloved by a goddess. Things just work out when I'm around, and Anathema is exceptional..." Azael waved one hand lazily. "Also, Rei is dumb. She truly believes I'm some powerhouse. The only thing really exceptional about me is my alcohol tolerance and my breasts."
"How many times have you answered these questions?"
Azael laughed, the sound rich and genuine. "Many, many times! Rei tried to get me drunk so I'd mess up an explanation."
"That's not very smart if you have high alcohol tolerance."
"See? Adorable and smart. Girls must love you."
Seraphine crossed her arms. "I'm not convinced yet."
"You just want an excuse to stare at me."
"Also don't take Ann that seriously." Azael's voice softened, losing its teasing edge. "She's a teenager. She hated me the first time too."
Seraphine turned toward her, the motion sharp with interest. "She did? Was it because of the flirting?"
Azael sighed, the sound carrying genuine concession. "Fine. I'll stop flirting with him out of respect for you."
"Are you that considerate?"
"I do everything to make my hero comfortable." Azael's grin returned, lazy and self-satisfied. "Aren't I the best?"
"You're a jerk."
"I know."
Seraphine shifted, drawing one knee up. "Go on. What happened?"
"Nothing happened. She was rude and mean, Rei kept trying to play mediator, Damion was a bit angry at her, but..." Azael's fingers traced patterns on the bedroll. "She... well, her mother had passed away very recently. I couldn't hold it against her."
"Oh."
"Yes. Some adventurers forget that normal people suffer too, you know?"
Seraphine laid down again, staring at the darkening sky through tree branches. "And now we took one of their incomes and made her feel bad again."
"It's all Rei's fault." Azael's voice turned wry. "She has this annoying habit of making people believe things. And it's wonderful to believe in something, but when it burns down..." A pause. "It's also crushing."
Seraphine's chest tightened. The words landed too close to something she couldn't name yet—Rei's network of displaced contacts, the regulations that broke what worked, the gap between believing systems functioned and watching them fail. "I met Rei just for a short time, but she seems like a better hero than I could ever be."
"Don't give up on our love like that."
Seraphine grabbed her curled blanket and hurled it across the space between them.
Azael caught it with a laugh, the fabric tangling around her arms.

Anathema emerged from the tree line first, roots shifting in empty sockets as he navigated toward the clearing. His massive hands cradled mushrooms and wild vegetables with surprising delicacy—each piece arranged like he'd selected them individually, which he probably had.
Damion followed moments later, a brace of rabbits slung over his shoulder. Blood darkened the fur where arrows had found their marks. Clean kills. Professional.
Ann trailed behind him, expression caught between angry and bored in that specific teenage way that suggested both emotions fought for dominance. Her jaw worked like she wanted to say something cutting but couldn't decide on the target.
Seraphine sat up, brushing dirt from her armor. "Good haul."
"Forest is generous if you know where to look." Damion dropped the rabbits near the fire pit they'd assembled. His gaze flicked to Ann, then away. "Start prepping these. I'll get the fire going."
Ann's glare could've melted steel.


* * *
Damion and Ann lead Seraphine, Azael, and Anathema through the forest, identifying fae markers—arranged stones, picked flowers, a ribbon, and disturbed berries—for Azael.
At the fae boundary, Damion and Ann wait while Azael sings to attract three fae. Anathema captures one. Seraphine intervenes against another, her magic repelling it. The fae, calling Seraphine "Caillech," release twelve caravan corpses and flee.
The group examines the claw-torn bodies, then summons transport.

Seraphine watched Damion and Ann move through the undergrowth, their footfalls silent despite the carpet of dry leaves. They avoided every twig, every brittle stem—instinct guiding them around noise before conscious thought registered the threat.
"Giant javali hunts this time of evening," Damion murmured, barely loud enough for her to catch. His hand gestured toward a depression in the soil, three-toed and deep. "Get one of those, hunters can live comfortable for three months. Maybe four if they're careful."
Ann nodded once, already shifting her path to avoid a cluster of dried reeds. No discussion needed. They moved like water finding channels, splitting and merging around obstacles without breaking rhythm.
Seraphine tried matching their silence. Failed. A branch cracked under her boot.
Both hunters paused, heads tilting in unison toward the sound, then continued without comment. Professional courtesy, maybe. Or just acknowledgment that adventurers weren't built for this kind of precision.
Rei had been right. This expertise could shave days off a contract, preserve energy for the actual fight instead of burning it wandering blind through wilderness. Seraphine had tracked before—followed blood trails, broken branches, obvious signs. But this was different. This was reading a language she didn't speak.
"Flowers picked," Ann said, crouching near a patch of wildflowers. "Three red, two yellow, one white."
Damion moved closer, examined the stems. "Clean cuts. Not torn."
They both turned toward Azael.
Azael glanced at Anathema, her fingers tapping against her thigh in that pattern Seraphine recognized now—counting, calculating. "Noted."
They continued deeper.
"Azael—stones moved into a circle. Seven of them. Same size."
Azael paused mid-step, head tilting. "Seven?"
"Seven," Damion confirmed.
Seraphine frowned. "What's significant about—"
"Ribbon caught on that branch." Ann pointed without approaching. "Looks like it's from a caravan supply pack, but it's tied in a bow."
Seraphine moved toward it, hand extending.
"Don't touch it." Azael's voice cut sharp.
Seraphine froze. "Why?"
"Just don't."
Ann continued scanning, her expression shifting from bored to focused. "Berries. All of them gone, but not eaten on site. No seeds, no juice stains. Whoever took them was... neat about it."
Damion crouched near a disturbed patch of earth, running fingers along parallel grooves. "See the drag marks? Parallel lines, consistent depth. But the person making the tracks..." He shook his head. "Doesn't make sense."
"Azael," Ann called back without turning. "Tracks are spaced weird. Like they're skipping. Or dancing."
Seraphine watched the exchange, watched how they gathered pieces—flowers, stones, ribbons, berries—and offered them to Azael like components of something larger. A puzzle. They weren't reading the forest for themselves. They were collecting data points, filtering information through their expertise before passing relevant fragments to someone who understood the pattern they couldn't see.
"More stones," Damion reported. "Five this time. Different arrangement. Circle again, but smaller."
"Flowers here too," Ann added. "Two red, one yellow, three white. Opposite from before."
Azael's jaw tightened. Her fingers stopped tapping.
Anathema's roots shifted, the motion almost agitated. His skull turned toward Azael, empty sockets somehow conveying question.
"Keep going," Azael said quietly. "Tell me everything."
Damion and Ann exchanged glances, then nodded. They pushed deeper into the forest, movements still silent, still precise. But their hands stayed near weapons now.
 
Damion stopped.
His hand rose—fist closed, the universal signal for halt. Ann mirrored him half a breath later, both of them staring into the deepening shadows ahead.
"We only go until here." Damion's voice held no room for negotiation. "The rest is... wrong. We can wait for you here if you need."
Seraphine frowned. "Wait, what's happening?"
Ann scoffed. "Fae, dumbass. We told you they like it here."
The word landed like ice water. Seraphine's hand moved instinctively toward her sword hilt.
"She's right," Azael said.
Silence stretched between Azael and Anathema—not the comfortable quiet of companionship, but something heavier. Communication without words, the kind that came from years of proximity. The elemental's roots coiled tighter against his frame.
Azael turned to the hunters. "Stay here. Count the time. If we don't return in ninety minutes, go to the guild. Ask for Marvenna specifically. Tell her what you found."
Damion nodded once.
Azael's attention shifted to Seraphine. "You know about fae? How comfortable are you with them?"
"Just theoretical," Seraphine admitted.
"Good enough." Azael's fingers resumed their tapping pattern. "Listen. I'll sing to get their attention. Your magic should protect you from most of their tricks, so stay hidden. Help if it gets out of hand."
She glanced at Anathema. "You grab one of them. We'll offer an exchange—her for the caravan."
"Do you think they're still alive?" Seraphine asked.
"Hard to say."
They moved forward. The forest changed—not abruptly, but in gradual increments that set Seraphine's teeth on edge. Trees grew closer together. Shadows fell wrong, pooling in places sunlight should reach. The air tasted sweet, cloying, like fruit left too long in summer heat.
Seraphine dropped back, letting darkness swallow her form. Her hand stayed near her weapon.
Azael stepped into a clearing ringed with stones—seven of them, precisely arranged. She inhaled once, then began.
The song emerged low and haunting, words Seraphine didn't recognize curling through the air like smoke. While your lips are still red... while he's still silent...
The glamour hit like a wall.
Pressure crushed against Seraphine's consciousness—beautiful, terrible, seductive. Every instinct screamed to step forward, to reveal herself, to join. Her heroic magic flared hot beneath her sternum, pushing back against the intrusion, creating space to think.
Anathema stood motionless. The song washed over him, through him, leaving no mark. Whatever the fae offered held no appeal for living wood.
The air rippled.
Reality tore—not violently, but like fabric pulled aside by delicate fingers. Through the gap, Seraphine glimpsed their realm. Impossible colors. Crystalline structures that hurt to perceive. And bodies.
The caravan members lay scattered like discarded toys, throats torn, eyes wide and empty. Not fae work—the wounds were too crude, too savage. Something else had killed them. The fae had simply... collected what remained.
Three figures emerged through the tear. Tall, willowy, features too perfect to be human. They circled Azael, drawn by her voice like moths to flame.
One drifted closer. Her hand extended, fingers reaching toward Azael's throat where the tattoos disappeared beneath her collar.
Anathema moved.
His arm swept out—faster than anything his size should manage. Roots wrapped around the fae's waist, lifted her off the ground. She shrieked, the sound like crystal shattering.
The other two recoiled, hissing.
Azael stopped singing. "Let's talk."

The fae's eyes locked onto Azael's throat, tracking the symmetrical patterns that vanished beneath fabric. Its fingers twitched, reaching, wanting—the gesture hungry in ways that had nothing to do with food.
"Pretty thing," it whispered. "Trade. Give us the singer, we give you—"
The second fae lunged.
Seraphine moved without thought. Her sword cleared the sheath, heroic magic flooding her muscles as she stepped between the creature and Azael. Golden light blazed from her eyes.
The fae recoiled like it had struck a wall. Its perfect features twisted, mouth opening in a soundless scream. The one trapped in Anathema's roots thrashed harder, clawing at the wood with increasing desperation.
"Caillech," the third one hissed—the word tasted wrong even to Seraphine's ears. Its gaze darted between her and the trapped companion, then to Azael still standing untouched in the center of the clearing.
The air rippled violently.
Reality buckled. The tear widened, and the fae realm convulsed—rejecting what it had taken. Bodies tumbled through the gap, landing in graceless heaps across the forest floor. Caravan supplies followed: crates, canvas tarps, personal belongings scattered like refuse.
Anathema released his captive.
She scrambled backward on all fours, never taking her eyes off Seraphine. The three of them clustered together at the edge of the clearing, beautiful faces twisted with something between rage and terror.
"Keep the dead ones," the first spat. "Keep the broken things. We want nothing touched by that."
Its hand stabbed toward Seraphine.
The tear sealed. Reality snapped back into place with an audible crack, leaving only settling dust and the cloying scent of overripe fruit.
Seraphine's grip on her sword loosened. Her magic ebbed, retreating beneath her skin like a tide pulling back from shore. "What did it call me?"
"Doesn't matter." Azael moved toward the bodies, her expression carefully neutral. "They're gone."
Twelve corpses lay scattered across the clearing. Throats torn, clothing shredded. The wounds were days old—long before the fae had claimed them. Whatever killed these people had done it with claws and teeth, not glamour and theft.
Anathema knelt beside the nearest body, roots extending to check for signs of life.
Nothing.
"We should get Damion and Ann," Seraphine said quietly.

The clearing felt lighter—air no longer thick with cloying sweetness. Footsteps approached through the undergrowth, deliberate and cautious.
Damion and Ann emerged from the treeline, weapons drawn. They paused at the edge of the scattered bodies, taking in the scene with professional detachment.
"It's been a hundred minutes, by the way." Ann lowered her bow. "We were heading back when the wind shifted."
Azael's fingers tapped against her thigh. "Ah. The realm distorted time enough for even ours to get caught in it. Interesting."
Seraphine pulled the communication crystal from her pack, thumbing it active. "I'm requesting transport. We need to bring them back."
"I'm going with you," Damion said. "They'll need help getting the carts through here."
Ann crouched near the nearest corpse, examining the throat wounds without touching. "We'll keep watch. Without the fae around, something will definitely try approaching."
Damion studied the torn flesh, then glanced at Azael. "What do you think did this?"
Anathema's roots shifted. "Something with fangs."
Seraphine looked up from the crystal. "Really?"
Azael hummed, the sound low and considering. "Yes, but..." Her head tilted. "Weird."
"Cecil would know." Ann shot Seraphine another glare. "That weirdo knows everything."
Damion sighed, suddenly looking exhausted. "Let's go. I'm tired and this place always gives me the creeps."
"Are you alright?" Seraphine asked Azael.
Azael's eyebrows rose. "Of course?"
The confusion felt genuine. Too genuine. Seraphine's jaw tightened, but the crystal warmed in her palm—the guild responding. She had work to do.
The rest of the day dragged. Transport arrived. Bodies loaded onto carts. Reports filed with mechanical precision. Through it all, Seraphine's chest felt tight, her heart beating too fast.
Wrong. Something was wrong.
Azael had stood in that clearing singing to fae—calling them—with no glamour affecting her, no hesitation, no fear. And Anathema. The supposedly protective construct gifted by Azael's mother figure had remained completely calm while fae circled, while one reached for Azael's throat with hungry fingers.
Fae were possessive. When they wanted something, they took it. They didn't give it back.
They didn't run.
Seraphine replayed the moment—the way that perfect face had twisted at the sight of her, the word spat like poison. Caillech. The terror in those crystalline eyes hadn't been directed at her sword or her magic.
It had been directed at her.
What had they seen that she couldn't?

Unfamiliar Situation
Chapter 5
Azael and Anathema discuss Seraphine's suspicions from the fae encounter and plan to act normal in their room. The next day at the church courtyard, Azael joins soup prep with Celeste and Mirtha; gossip about heroes circulates. Rei and her group, including Seraphine, arrive; old ladies assign Seraphine to chop vegetables beside Azael, sparking flirtatious banter and teasing. Ann delivers hunted meat, Cecil brings mushrooms; the bartender offers drinks, fueling more playful jealousy from Azael.

 
Chapter 4 - Scene 2 (Continued)
Water dripped from Azael's hair onto the pillow. She'd braided it loosely, too tired to care about damp sheets. The mattress dipped as she stretched out, muscles protesting after hours of forest trudging and diplomatic body-hauling.
Anathema stood motionless by the window, branches barely visible against the darkened glass.
"I messed up."
Roots shifted—his version of turning. "Why? We did well."
"She was looking too much, too close." Azael draped an arm across her eyes. "She knows something is wrong. You should have pretended better."
"I was quiet like a doll." His voice carried no inflection, just stating fact. "You shouldn't have sung."
A groan escaped her throat. "If I didn't, we would have stayed there forever. And their realm was too open, too close—they would see Seraphine's aura, would approach, and when they noticed it, they would strike..." Her hand gestured vaguely, punctuating the inevitability.
"Not much choice. Rei wasn't there to look away."
The reminder stung. Rei would've provided perfect distraction—eager questions, genuine curiosity about technique rather than suspicion. Heroes investigating other heroes felt natural. Heroes investigating random guild members with weird constructs and convenient timing? That drew attention.
"We'll need to be extra careful. Extra normal."
"That won't work." Anathema's branches creaked softly. "She was looking at you like Celeste looks at Damion when he isn't looking."
Azael's arm lifted. "Like he needs a shower?"
Silence stretched. Then Anathema's frame shifted—almost a sigh, if wood could sigh. "No. Like it's something she doesn't understand but wants to."
"They have something special." Azael waved dismissively. "But to Seraphine, I'm someone hiding something. Heroes are curious—take Rei for example."
Anathema kept silent.
The quiet settled heavy. Outside, night sounds filtered through—distant tavern noise, guard patrols changing shift, somewhere a dog barking. Normal sounds. Safe sounds. The kind that disappeared when people started asking questions with golden eyes and hero-grade persistence.
Azael stared at the ceiling beams. "It's fine. I'll think of something. Maybe I should get a date..."
Her mind spun possibilities—create obvious, mundane secrets for Seraphine to uncover. A fake romantic entanglement, financial troubles, family drama. Something to satisfy that investigative itch before it dug too deep. Heroes loved solving problems. Give them a problem to solve.
Anathema shook his head, the motion deliberate. "Sleep. Tomorrow we think."
"I'm not tired."
"You haven't eaten in two days."
"Didn't feel like it."
"Sleep anyway." His roots settled into their resting configuration. "Brain works better after."
Azael's fingers drummed against her ribs. Her threads spread unconsciously through the room—habit more than purpose—mapping familiar territory. Window frame, door hinges, Anathema's solid presence. Safe. Contained. Controllable.
Unlike golden eyes that tracked too precisely. Unlike questions asked with careful casualness. Unlike the way Seraphine had looked at her in that clearing, sword still glowing, face caught between confusion and determination.
What did they see that I couldn't?
The question had been genuine. Vulnerable, even. And dangerous, because it meant Seraphine knew she'd missed something important.
"You're not sleeping."
"Shut up."
"Your threads are twitching."
Azael retracted them with more force than necessary. The sudden absence left the room feeling exposed. She rolled onto her side, pulling the blanket higher. "Fine. Sleeping now."
"Liar."
But his voice carried warmth—or the wooden equivalent. Affection wrapped in blunt observation. Tomorrow they'd plan. Tomorrow she'd figure out how to be more convincingly normal, less obviously wrong.
Tonight, she'd pretend rest came easily.
 
Chapter 4 - Scene 2 (Continued)
Water dripped steadily from Azael's braid, darkening the pillow. She shifted, seeking a dry spot that didn't exist.
"The fae were scared." Anathema's statement landed flat in the darkness.
"Old ones would've recognized you." Azael stared at the ceiling beams. "These were babies. Probably don't even remember why their elders avoid certain forests."
"Good."
"Is it?" She rolled onto her back. "Because now Seraphine thinks I walked into fae territory like it was a fucking picnic. Which—"
"You did."
"—which looks insane to anyone with basic survival instincts."
Anathema's branches shifted. No disagreement there.
The last time they'd encountered fae, Azael had been younger. Smaller. Still learning that her voice carried weight in certain spaces, drew attention from things that shouldn't notice her. Dawn had broken pink across the meadow, and she'd been singing—just singing, because the Goddess liked when she sang.
The fae had materialized between heartbeats.
Anathema moved. The Goddess moved faster.
Golden fire. The kind that didn't burn wood or grass, just wrong things. Things that didn't belong. The fae had screamed—not pain, something worse. Recognition maybe. Fear definitely.
They'd scattered like smoke.
"How do I explain that?" Azael's fingers drummed against her ribs. "Oh, don't worry about the fae, they're terrified of my creator who may or may not be a deity and definitely torched their relatives once? That'll go over brilliantly."
"Don't explain."
"She's already suspicious."
"Let her be suspicious of other things." Anathema's roots scraped softly against floorboards. "You've hidden before."
"Not from a Hero who's decided I'm her current puzzle." Azael pulled the blanket higher, damp fabric clinging. "She'll keep looking. Poking. Asking those careful questions that aren't careful at all."
The room settled into silence. Outside, night sounds continued—tavern noise fading, guard patrols, the ever-present background hum of a town preparing for sleep.
Azael's mind spun possibilities, discarded them. Every explanation led back to questions she couldn't answer. Why didn't the fae take you? Why would they fear a random guild member? What exactly is your construct, and why does it move like something alive?
Because he is alive, and they remember what happens when things threaten me.
Not an answer she could give.
"Tomorrow's Clara's soup day." She changed direction, seeking safer mental territory.
"You'll help."
"Probably." Azael's fingers found the edge of her braid, worrying at damp strands. "Remember when we were the ones lining up?"
Anathema didn't respond. Didn't need to.
She remembered—hollow stomach, desperate enough to wait hours for lukewarm broth and stale bread. Before the Goddess found her. Before Anathema. When kindness from strangers meant survival, and she'd memorized which charity kitchens asked fewer questions.
Clara's operation asked none. Just served. Fed whoever showed up with the same steady efficiency she applied to everything.
"It's nice." Azael's voice softened. "Being on the other side."
"You always take extra shifts."
"Because I remember." She closed her eyes. "Besides, keeps me busy. Normal. Just another guild member helping the community."
"While the Hero watches."
"She won't be there." But Azael's certainty wavered. Seraphine seemed the type to investigate everything, taste every experience. Community service would appeal to that heroic instinct.
"She has better things to do."
Azael rolled again, seeking comfort the mattress refused to provide. Tomorrow she'd serve soup, smile at strangers, pretend normalcy came naturally. Maybe Seraphine would appear, maybe not. Either way, she'd play the role—helpful guild member, nothing suspicious, definitely not someone whose construct could wade through fae territory like a battlefield it was designed for.
Just normal. Stay normal.
The sun hit too bright, too early. Azael squinted behind dark lenses, the iced coffee sweating in her palm as condensation dripped between her fingers. Her loose shirt hung off one shoulder, fabric light against skin that still remembered yesterday's forest chill. The high collar exposed her neck tattoos fully—symmetrical black flames crawling from collarbone to jaw.
Anathema's heavy footfalls crunched gravel behind her.
"You said thirty minutes."
"I said maybe thirty minutes." Azael took a long pull from the coffee, ice rattling. "Big difference."
"Two hours ago."
"Time is a construct." She waved dismissively, nearly spilling. "Besides, not my fault. Kept thinking about fae. Their faces when they saw—"
"You should sleep more. Drink less alcohol. More water."
Azael stopped walking. Turned. Stared up at the blank space where eyes should be. "Have you been reading Mirtha's health magazines again?"
Roots shifted—caught. "I don't sleep."
"You should try. Might loosen you up."
"I'm wood."
"Exactly my point."
The church courtyard sprawled ahead, already buzzing. Familiar voices carried across dirt packed hard from countless charity days. Mirtha's laugh boomed above the general noise, her round frame shaking as she chatted with another woman near the supply tent. 
Smaller figures darted between stations—kids betting loudly on who could haul more potato sacks. Tomé staggered past with two, face red with effort and determination. Another boy trailed with one, talking elaborate trash.
Movement caught her peripheral vision. Celeste waved, blonde hair catching sunlight as she grabbed two aprons and ran toward them.
"You came!" She arrived breathless, smile wide. "I heard about the Red Forest and I was scared... How are Damian and Ann?"
Azael's smirk came automatic. "He was handsome as always. Single, apparently."
Pink bloomed across Celeste's cheeks.
"And Ann..." Azael shrugged, sipping coffee. "Well, she's a teenager. That answers itself."
Celeste laughed, offering an apron. Azael took it one-handed, still clutching her drink. The second apron looked comically small against Anathema's frame, but he accepted it with careful precision, branches working the ties into something resembling secure.
"Great!" Celeste watched him adjust, then glanced back at Azael. "Did they mention if they're coming today?"
"I'm still surprised you knew I'd seen him." Azael draped the apron over her shoulder, untied. "Interesting."
Celeste's head tilted, genuine confusion crossing her features. "Wasn't that obvious? Red Forest quest... Of course you'd go with Damian." Her expression shifted—realization dawning. "Oh, you mean the rule about non-adventurers? As if you'd follow rules."
The observation landed flat, matter-of-fact. Not accusation, just statement.
Azael grinned. "You're learning."
"Clara says you're a terrible influence."
"Clara says that about everyone interesting." Azael finally set down her coffee, pulling the apron properly into place. The fabric settled crooked. She ignored it. "Where do you need us?"
"Vegetable prep?" Celeste gestured toward a table already crowded with volunteers. "Mirtha's handling the actual cooking, but we need everything chopped before noon rush."
Anathema moved without prompting, his frame clearing a path through the growing crowd. People shifted automatically, giving the wooden construct space even as they called greetings to Azael.
She followed in his wake, coffee retrieved and nearly empty. Normal. Helpful. Just another guild member giving back to the community.
Totally ordinary.
Mirtha's thick fingers clamped around Azael's wrist before she'd taken three steps. The old baker's grip carried surprising strength, steering them both toward her supply tent with the inevitability of a landslide.
"Right." Mirtha pointed at the vegetable crates stacked waist-high. "You go cut some vegetables." Then her attention swung to Anathema, chin lifting to meet his eyeless face. "And you, big guy—distract the kids. Make sure they don't die, kill each other, or end up crying."
Anathema's frame shifted, processing. A slow nod followed.
He turned toward Azael. Roots twisted in their sockets—question implicit.
"You heard her, handsome." Azael waved her nearly-empty coffee. "Nothing's going to snatch me away."
"I bet you wanted some hero to snatch you away."
The words hit sharp, casual. Mirtha didn't look up from sorting aprons by size, but her shoulders shook with contained laughter.
Azael's jaw tightened. "You need more work. Or a hobby."
"This is my hobby."
Other women perked up like hunting dogs catching scent. Old faces turned their direction, conversations dying mid-sentence as attention zeroed in. Widow Martinez set down her bread basket. The seamstress whose name Azael could never remember leaned closer, eyes bright with interest.
Fresh gossip. Better than currency in these circles.
Mirtha warmed to her audience, voice carrying deliberately. "This one couldn't keep her eyes off a pretty hero the other day."
Heat crawled up Azael's neck—not embarrassment, just irritation at being obvious. She'd been careful. Mostly. Seraphine had just been... there. Fighting well. Looking competent. That was professional observation, nothing more.
Anathema's branches rustled—amusement in the sound.
"Traitor," Azael muttered.
He inclined his head, something almost apologetic in the gesture, then turned away. His heavy footfalls retreated toward the children's area, already drawing excited shouts. Small voices called his name, feet pounding dirt as they swarmed.
Azael watched him go. Wished desperately to follow.
"Good luck." His voice drifted back, barely audible.
"I hate you."
But he'd already disappeared behind the supply tent, kids trailing like ducklings.
Mirtha thrust a knife into Azael's hand. "Carrots first. Small dice."
The other women closed in, forming a loose semicircle around the vegetable station. Strategic positioning. Maximum gossip efficiency.
Widow Martinez spoke first, settling onto a stool with theatrical interest. "A hero, you say?"
"The one from the capital." The seamstress nodded knowingly. "Brown hair? Athletic build?"
"Golden eyes," someone else added. "Saw her at the trials. Quite striking."
Azael grabbed a carrot, attacking it with more force than necessary. Orange chunks scattered across the cutting board. "There's no crush. Mirtha's delusional."
"I saw you staring at the guild hall." Mirtha dumped potatoes beside the carrots. "Practically drooling."
"I was drinking coffee."
"Both can be true."
Laughter rippled through the assembled women. They settled in like theater patrons anticipating a good show, work-worn hands finding tasks that positioned them for optimal listening.
This was going to be a long day.
Azael chopped faster, hoping efficiency would discourage conversation. It wouldn't. These women could extract gossip from stone if properly motivated, and Mirtha had just served them premium material.
"So what's she like?" Another grandmother piped up, already peeling potatoes. "The hero?"
"Persistent."
"Ooh, you like that."
"I don't—" Azael's knife hit the board hard. "Can we focus on feeding people?"
"We can multitask." Mirtha's grin spread wide and wicked. "Tell us more about this persistent hero."
Agnes leaned closer, voice dropping to that conspiratorial purr reserved for particularly scandalous revelations. "So then Sarah told me—and you won't believe this—that her daughter found the butcher's boy behind the—"
Commotion erupted across the courtyard. Voices rose, feet pounded dirt, bodies converged on a single point already thick with gathering spectators.
Agnes straightened, knife hovering mid-chop. "Now what's that shit?"
Azael shrugged, not bothering to look up from her cabbage. "Maybe some free stuff?"
Small bodies streaked past their station in a blur of excited energy. High-pitched voices carried clear above the general noise.
"It's Aza's hero!"
Azael's jaw locked. The knife hit the cutting board harder than necessary.
Agnes dissolved into laughter, the sound rich and delighted. Other women joined immediately, knowing chuckles rippling through the workspace.
"Oh, funny. Very funny." Azael attacked the cabbage with renewed focus. "Now go on, old lady, what were you saying about Sarah?"
Heavy footfalls approached before Agnes could continue. Anathema's shadow fell across the vegetable station.
"Rei is here."
That got attention.
Heads snapped up. The older ladies abandoned their knives like someone had announced free wine, already moving toward the commotion with surprising speed for their collective age. Even Agnes went, curiosity overriding her story.
Azael sighed, watching the exodus. 
Anathema remained, solid and still beside the now-abandoned workspace. His frame shifted slightly—question forming.
"Should we go?"
"You know Rei." Azael continued chopping, movements efficient. "Soon she'll tell everyone to go back to work. If we're lucky she won't scream at us because of the trials."
Agreement settled in the slight angle of his branches.
Rei's voice cut through the excited chatter, clear and commanding even at distance. "I'm very happy that you're all glad to see me, but the food is more important. Soon starving people will show up and we need to be ready."
Azael smirked, reaching for fresh cabbage. Predictable.
Mirtha hadn't moved from her post either, still sorting through potato sacks with methodical efficiency. Her chuckle carried warm amusement. "They still don't know how she works, huh?"
Azael nodded.
Anathema tilted his head, roots shifting thoughtfully. "She was gone longer this time. They miss her."
"But some people, big boy, are simply focused on other things." Mirtha hefted another sack. "Rei will gladly meet every one of them... after people are fed."
The observation landed with the weight of long familiarity. Rei's priorities never shifted—duty first, socializing after. Anyone who'd worked with her more than once learned fast.
Clara emerged from the dispersing crowd, already making a beeline for Rei. Probably listing which stations needed reinforcement, where supplies ran low, what adjustments the afternoon rush would require.
Movement caught Azael's peripheral vision. More figures following in Rei's wake, their presence drawing fresh murmurs from the crowd.
Irene's tall frame, unmistakable. Selene beside her, hand resting casual on sword pommel out of habit. Lina's ponytail bouncing as she scanned the setup with obvious technical interest. Sora's doll-like features serene, already cataloging who needed healing attention. Val's broad shoulders, Seb's lean build, even Ananas lurking at the edges like shadows made flesh.
And behind them all, golden eyes sweeping the courtyard with that same careful observation—
Seraphine.
Azael's knife stopped moving.
"Well." Mirtha's voice carried entirely too much satisfaction. "Looks like your hero came after all."
Azael heard Agnes's voice boom across the courtyard. "Clara, dear, we need more hands here, we are all old, our joints are tired."
Her brow twitched.
Mirtha's laugh burst out, rich and entirely too delighted.
"I can help." Anathema shifted toward the commotion.
Mirtha waved him off. "They just want Rei to be here, honey, don't worry yourself."
Anathema's frame angled back toward Azael. "Oh."
"I'm choking Agnes," Azael muttered, attacking carrots with renewed violence. "Painfully. Slowly."
"Don't tell her that." Mirtha's eyes sparkled. "She may enjoy it."
The knife stopped mid-chop. "First of all—disgusting. I didn't need to know that." Azael glared. "Second, whose side are you on?"
Mirtha winked. "I'm on the side of drama."
"I hate you."
"You love me."
Unfortunately true.
Agnes reappeared, her weathered hand clamped around Rei's wrist, dragging the shorter woman through the crowd. Rei's face carried that earnest concern she wore whenever someone mentioned health problems, completely missing the manipulation in play.
"—should really see the healer about that," Rei was saying, dead serious. "Joint pain at your age isn't something to ignore."
Agnes made appropriately distressed noises.
They stopped at the vegetable station. Rei's face brightened seeing Mirtha, then immediately darkened when her gaze landed on Azael.
"You jerk!" Rei pointed accusingly. "I told you to take things seriously!"
Nervous laughter escaped before Azael could stop it. "I'm sorry, mom. Things got complicated."
"Complicated—" Rei drew breath for what promised to be a thorough lecture.
"Do you need more people?" Seraphine's voice cut through, clear and helpful. She approached with Lina and Sora trailing behind. "We're free."
Azael's lips pressed into a thin line. She focused very intently on the cabbage, willing the hero to get assigned literally anywhere else.
Marta materialized behind Agnes, returning from whatever errand had taken her. Her grin spread wicked and knowing as she surveyed the scene.
"Of course we need help." Marta's hand shot out, finger pointing directly at Seraphine. "You—you can help Azael here." The finger swung to jab in Azael's direction. "She's slow."
"I'm not—"
"Very slow," Agnes agreed cheerfully. "Terribly inefficient."
"I've chopped three times what you—"
"Poor thing needs guidance." Mirtha didn't even try hiding her amusement.
Rei looked between them, confusion crossing her features. Then understanding dawned—too late, as always when it came to reading social situations. Her mouth opened.
"Actually," Azael cut in before Rei could derail the conspiracy, "Seraphine would be better helping Clara coordinate. She's a hero, she shouldn't waste time—"
"Nonsense." Marta waved dismissively. "Clara has plenty of help. We need someone strong here." Her eyes raked over Seraphine with exaggerated assessment. "And you look strong."
Golden eyes met Azael's. Something flickered there—amusement maybe, or determination.
"I'd be happy to help," Seraphine said.
Azael's jaw clenched. The cabbage received her full attention, knife moving with mechanical precision.
Anathema's branches rustled. If wood could laugh...
"Traitors," Azael muttered under her breath. "All of you."
Mirtha's hand patted her shoulder, the gesture patronizing and gleeful. "Welcome to community service, dear."
Azael's gaze drifted to Seraphine—sleeveless shirt exposing toned arms, hair tied up in that practical way that somehow looked deliberate. Rested. Alert. Annoyingly attractive.
Seraphine caught her looking. The smirk came instant. "Now who's staring?"
Azael's eyebrow arched. "Oh, of course I'm looking. Look at those arms—you'll make all these old ladies faint. They're used to beer bellies."
Laughter erupted around the station. Genuine, warm, the kind that came from women who'd stopped caring about propriety decades ago.
Marta wiped her eyes. "I hate to agree with that."
Agnes nodded vigorously. "Well, we're either divorced or widowed. Let us enjoy a good show."
Lina stepped forward, rolling up her own sleeves with theatrical flair. She flexed, muscles defined from years hauling equipment. "What about these?"
More laughter. The old women applauded, delighted.
Seraphine grabbed a knife, settling beside Azael with easy confidence. Sora took position on her other side, already reaching for carrots with methodical efficiency.
"So." Seraphine's knife moved through a potato, precise cuts. "Where's your wooden shadow?"
Azael jerked her chin toward the children's area. "With the kids."
Three small bodies clung to Anathema's frame—one on each arm, another attempting to scale his back. The rest formed a circle around him, shouting encouragement and betting on who'd reach the top first.
Lina's eyes locked onto the scene with laser focus. "Poor guy." Her voice carried zero sympathy, all fascination. "Also I'm obsessed. I think I can build something like him—do you have the project? Can I see it?"
Azael shook her head, chopping cabbage. "As I told Seraphine, it was a gift. Didn't really ask for blueprints."
Lina sighed, dramatic and wounded. "A shame. What about—"
"No." Azael cut her off. "No reverse engineering."
"You're making this too hard."
Seraphine and Sora chuckled, shared amusement passing between them.
Fingers pinched Azael's cheek—sharp, punishing. Rei's grip carried years of practice inflicting maximum annoyance.
"You asshole." Rei tugged. "I told you to take it seriously. I needed you at least Level Two, dumbass."
"Not my fault!" Azael whined, batting at her hand. "Mana requirements and all that."
Rei released her with a final warning squeeze. "Irene and I are talking. We'll handle this." She grabbed a potato, knife moving with the same decisive efficiency she applied to everything. "Ah, and it's a great time to go around apologizing to people."
Her tone suggested that wasn't optional.
"Oh, Sera told me about the Child Eater and the fae." Rei's knife paused. "It's always weird how fae are drawn to you."
Azael's smirk came automatic. "It's my boobs. Seraphine would agree."
Seraphine choked on nothing. Her knife stopped mid-cut, golden eyes going wide before narrowing with something between indignation and reluctant amusement.
Sora's expression remained serene, but pink crept across her cheeks.
Heat flooded Seraphine's face. The knife trembled in her grip, knuckles white as she fought for composure that had already abandoned ship.
The old ladies erupted—pure, delighted chaos. Laughter bounced between them, feeding on itself until Marta had to lean against the table for support.
Mirtha wiped her eyes. "Oh, my boobs were damn great when I was young. I was proud of them too."
"Mine were always ugly." Marta's voice carried zero shame, just matter-of-fact assessment.
Agnes waved her knife like a professor making a crucial point. "It's all about the confidence, honey, not the appearance."
Azael winked at Seraphine. Slow, deliberate. Entirely too pleased with herself.
Seraphine found her voice, though it came out strangled. "You won't let that go, really?"
"What's the fun in that?" Azael's smirk widened. "You have your guns, I have mine."
The double meaning landed obvious. Intentional.
Rei's knife stopped moving. Her head swiveled between them, confusion morphing into realization. "Wait, are you two flirting?"
Mirtha and Marta dissolved again, the sound rolling across the courtyard. Agnes's weathered hand clamped onto Rei's arm, grip almost tender.
"So pretty, and so slow." Agnes patted her gently. "Nobody can be perfect."
Rei's brow furrowed. "What—"
"It's not flirting." Azael attacked a carrot with renewed focus. "Seraphine just likes boobs."
"I do not!" The protest burst out too fast, too loud. Seraphine's face burned hotter.
Lina chimed in, voice bright with helpful betrayal. "You totally do. It's kind of embarrassing sometimes."
Seraphine's jaw dropped. "Lina—"
"See!" Azael gestured triumphantly. "We're all victims here."
Heat crawled down Seraphine's neck. Every denial would just dig deeper—they all knew it, she knew it, and Azael's smirk said she was enjoying every second.
"Oh shut up!" Seraphine rounded on Azael. "You were staring at my arms."
"Who isn't?"
The casual admission stripped any accusation from the observation. Just stating facts, her tone suggested. Universal truth.
Lina nodded vigorously. "That's another great point, by the way."
Seraphine's knife hit the cutting board. She focused very intently on the potato, willing the heat in her face to recede. The old ladies' continued laughter didn't help. Neither did Azael's presence beside her, radiating smug satisfaction.
Sora worked in serene silence, but the slight curve of her lips betrayed amusement.
Rei still looked lost, her gaze tracking between them like watching a sport she didn't understand the rules for.
Anathema's heavy footfalls approached, three children still clinging to his frame. More trailed behind, reluctant to abandon their climbing apparatus.
"Everything good?" His voice carried genuine question.
"Perfect," Azael said sweetly. "Just educating Seraphine about community dynamics."
Seraphine grabbed another potato, refusing to look up. Her face still burned. The knife moved with mechanical precision, channeling embarrassment into productivity.
Agnes leaned closer, voice dropping to that conspiratorial purr. "Don't worry, dear. She flirts with everyone who blushes prettily."
"I'm not—" Seraphine started.
"You are," Lina confirmed helpfully.
Seraphine chopped faster, hoping efficiency would discourage further commentary. It wouldn't. These women had found premium entertainment, and they'd milk it for everything it was worth.
Azael hummed something tuneless, working through her vegetable pile with infuriating calm.
The morning stretched ahead. Long, mortifying, and punctuated by far too much laughter at Seraphine's expense.
Clara's frame appeared in the tent entrance, curiosity written across her weathered features. "All this laughing—I was curious!"
Agnes didn't look up from her potatoes. "Oh dear, your pure ears aren't ready for this conversation."
Clara's eyebrow arched, expression caught between amusement and suspicion.
Rei's knife paused mid-cut. "Honestly, I don't know what's happening."
Mirtha's chuckle rumbled warm and knowing. "So pure."
Agnes set down her knife, turning to assess Seraphine with the same critical eye she'd apply to prize livestock. "And with arms..." Her gaze raked over defined muscle, lingering with zero shame. "Yours too, by the way. Top two."
Azael's laugh burst out, genuine and delighted.
Sora's hand flew to her mouth, but the giggle escaped anyway—soft, barely audible. Seraphine shot her a look that promised retribution later.
Lina straightened, indignation coloring her voice. "Wait, if she's top two, what am I?"
Clara laughed, the sound rich and unbothered. "So you're all getting along—excellent." She moved further into the workspace, already scanning their progress. "I wanted more meat, but some plates would have to go without. Mirtha, I trust your seasoning."
Seraphine grabbed the opportunity like a lifeline. "Oh, do you need meat? We can go buy more."
Clara shook her head, practical as always. "No more money, dear, but thank you."
"We can go hunting." Lina's suggestion came immediate, already mentally cataloguing what gear they'd need.
"No need, this is all—"
Ann's head appeared in the tent entrance, cutting Clara off mid-sentence. "Hey, Clara, where can we leave the meat?"
Every knife stopped moving. Heads turned toward the teenager.
Clara blinked. "What? Oh, you shouldn't have..."
"Too late." Ann's shrug carried teenage nonchalance. "Dad and I took a long time to hunt them." She jerked her thumb over her shoulder. "Also, some fishers are coming this way. Lots of baskets."
Clara's face transformed—pure joy radiating like sunlight breaking through clouds. "Oh thank gods! Yes, I'll find a place!"
She practically ran from the tent, energy renewed.
Ann's glare locked onto Seraphine, sharp and assessing. Then her attention shifted to Rei. "You're back, huh?"
"Yup!" Rei's smile came easy. "And I kind of need to talk to you and your father."
"He's cleaning the meat."
"Excellent. Is Celeste with him?"
Ann's eyes rolled with theatrical disgust. "Of course. They're glued by the hips or some shit like that. Disgusting."

Clara burst back into the tent, her weathered face radiant with an energy that belied her years. "Forget what I said—we have meat! A LOT of it, and fishes too!" She clapped her hands together. "But now we have a new problem. I need more hands to clean the fish."
Lina's eyes lit up like someone had just offered her access to a royal armory. "I have the PERFECT tool for that!"
"Yes, please." Clara gestured emphatically. "I need hands and brains."
Azael set down her knife, backing away from the cutting board with exaggerated wariness. "I don't want to be smelling of fish. Hero, go help them."
Seraphine scoffed, her nose wrinkling. "No way. I can cook fish, but I can't clean them."
Sora's sigh carried the weight of long-suffering patience. "Honestly."
She dried her hands on her apron, movements precise and deliberate, then followed Lina toward the tent entrance. "I'll do it. Sera, please, don't get near the fishes."
The plea hung in the air with the gravity of personal experience.
Mirtha's chuckle rumbled deep. "Oh, this seems a good story."
"It's not... really." Seraphine's protest lacked conviction, heat already creeping up her neck.
Azael leaned forward, chin propped on her palm, sunglasses sliding down enough to expose dark eyes glinting with mischief. "Spoilsport. I'll let you peek my cleavage if you tell us."
"I don't—oh shut up, you're insufferable!" Seraphine grabbed a carrot, attacking it with unnecessary violence.
Marta's expression softened, going distant with memory. "I miss my Berto. We used to be exactly like that."
Agnes's laugh cracked sharp. "He's still alive and you two are still married."
"Yes, but that start was so delicious." Marta's smile turned wicked, remembering.
Azael grimaced. "Oh gods, we don't wanna know."
Cecil barged through the tent flap, staggering under a basket overflowing with mushrooms of varying sizes and colors. "I have many of those! Where do I put them? Ohhhh, hey, Aza!" His face lit up. "Where's my archenemy?"
Azael jerked her chin toward the courtyard. "Some kids are climbing him outside."
Cecil's young face shone with competitive glee. "I found a new species last week. I doubt he knows about it."
"Oh?" Azael lifted her sunglasses, studying him with sudden interest. "Let's bet, then. A basket of those pretty apples from your garden if he knows, and if he doesn't, I get you a date with Ann."
Cecil gasped, basket nearly slipping from his grip. "DEAL!"
He sprinted from the tent, mushroom basket bouncing dangerously.
The old ladies dissolved into laughter again, the sound rolling across the workspace.
Mirtha wiped her eyes. "Does that kid know that Anathema knows everything about trees?"
Agnes nodded sagely. "Of course he does. He's like us—we know all the gossip."
Seraphine looked at Azael, golden eyes narrowing with skepticism. "You can get him a date? Ann doesn't seem the type to agree..."
"Of course I can't." Azael's smirk spread slow and satisfied. "But Anathema will win, so..."
Comprehension dawned across Seraphine's features. "That's—you're terrible."
"I'm practical." Azael returned to her vegetables, humming something tuneless. "Cecil gets his pride bruised, I get fresh apples, everyone wins."
"Everyone except Cecil."
"He'll survive." Azael waved dismissively. "Character building."
Rei's confusion deepened, her knife hovering forgotten over a half-chopped potato. "Wait, what just happened?"
Marta patted her arm, the gesture almost maternal. "You're so pretty and so slow."
Ann reappeared in the entrance, arms crossed. "Clara wants to know if anyone can help gut the deer. Dad's teaching Celeste, but—" Her nose wrinkled with teenage disgust. "She keeps giggling at everything he says. It's nauseating."
The old ladies exchanged knowing glances, smiles spreading.
"Young love," Agnes sighed dramatically.
"Disgusting," Ann corrected flatly, then vanished again.
Seraphine caught Azael watching her—not the quick glances from before, but direct assessment. Golden eyes met dark ones across the cutting board.
"What?"
Azael's lips curved. "Just thinking about that fish story you won't tell."
"There's no story."
"Liar."
Heat climbed Seraphine's neck again, unstoppable and infuriating.

Seraphine set down her knife, curiosity overtaking caution. "Okay, so Damian and Celeste have a thing. And Cecil has a crush on Ann. Is that so?"
Heads nodded in unison—the synchronized movement of women who'd witnessed every romantic entanglement in town for decades.
Agnes leaned forward, voice dropping to that conspiratorial purr. "Celeste looks at Damian as if she could swallow him whole, and he looks at her as if she built the sky."
The poetry in the observation caught Seraphine off-guard. Something wistful tugged at her chest—recognition of something she'd never quite experienced herself. "That seems nice..."
"Oh, are you giving up on our love again?"
Seraphine's head snapped toward Azael. The woman hadn't even looked up from her carrots, knife moving with infuriating calm, but that smirk played at the corners of her mouth.
Heat flooded Seraphine's face. Again. "There's no—we're not—"
"So fickle." Azael tsked, shaking her head with mock disappointment. "What happened to all that staring in the forest?"
The old ladies leaned in collectively, audience scenting fresh drama.
Seraphine grabbed another potato, channeling embarrassment into aggressive chopping. "You don't look at me as if you could swallow me up."
The words escaped before she'd thought them through. Defensive. Petulant, even.
Silence crashed across the workspace.
Azael's knife stopped mid-cut. Her sunglasses slid down her nose, dark eyes fixing on Seraphine with an intensity that made breathing difficult. "So rude!"
But her voice carried something else beneath the mock offense—amusement, yes, but also... consideration. Like Seraphine had accidentally revealed something interesting.
Mirtha coughed, the sound suspiciously like suppressed laughter.
Marta abandoned all pretense, shoulders shaking as she set down her knife. "Oh my gods."
"I didn't mean—" Seraphine scrambled for recovery. "That came out wrong."
"Did it?" Azael's smirk widened, predatory now. She pushed her sunglasses back up with one finger, but those light eyes kept tracking. "Because it sounded like you were disappointed I'm not devouring you with my gaze."
"That's not—I was making a point about the comparison!"
"What comparison?" Rei's confusion had reached critical levels. "Are we still talking about Damian and Celeste?"
Agnes patted her arm again. "No, dear. We've moved on."
"To what?"
"Flirting," Mirtha supplied helpfully.
"We're not flirting!" Seraphine and Azael said simultaneously, then glared at each other.
The old ladies dissolved completely, laughter rolling across the tent in waves.
Marta wiped her eyes. "Oh, you two are delicious."
Seraphine grabbed her knife, focusing very intently on the potato that had become collateral damage in this conversation. Her face burned. Her hands trembled slightly. Azael's presence beside her felt magnified—too close, too warm, too aware of every breath.
"For what it's worth," Azael said quietly, voice pitched low enough the others couldn't hear over their continued chuckling, "I do look. You just never notice when I'm actually being subtle."
Seraphine's knife slipped. She caught it before disaster, but her pulse hammered against her ribs. "You're never subtle."
"Exactly." Azael returned to her vegetables, humming again. "Which is why you miss it when I am."
The logic made no sense. The implication made Seraphine's stomach flip in ways she absolutely refused to examine.
Rei looked between them, utterly lost. "I still don't understand what's happening."
"That's alright, honey." Agnes smiled warmly. "Neither do they."
The tent flap rustled. Movement caught peripheral attention—someone entering with purpose, arms laden with drinks.
The bartender from the tavern.
Her auburn hair caught the filtered sunlight, tied back in a practical bun that still managed to look deliberate. She wore the same fitted vest from the other night, sleeves rolled to expose toned forearms as she maneuvered a tray of cups with practiced ease.
"Thought you all could use some refreshment," she called out, smile bright and helpful.
The old ladies exchanged glances—the kind that carried entire conversations without words.
Marta's eyebrow lifted. Agnes's smile turned knowing. Mirtha set down her knife, settling back to observe with the air of someone watching their favorite theater production.
The bartender's gaze swept the workspace, landed on Seraphine, and lit up. "Oh, Seraphine! I didn't know you'd be here."
Seraphine looked up from her potato, offering an automatic smile. "Just helping out for the day."
"That's so generous." The bartender moved closer, setting down the tray with careful precision that positioned her directly in Seraphine's line of sight. "Really, your service to the community—it's inspiring. We're all so grateful for everything you do."
Warmth spread across Seraphine's cheeks. The earnest praise always made her uncomfortable in ways she couldn't quite articulate. "Just doing what anyone would."
"No, really. You're special."
Azael's knife hit the cutting board with deliberate force. Her voice dripped theatrical devastation. "What, you're cheating on me already?"
Seraphine's head whipped toward her. "I'm not—we're not even—"
Mirtha leaned forward, eyes sparkling with malicious glee. "So you two are together?"
"No!" Seraphine's protest came too fast, too loud. "We're not together, we've never been together, there's nothing to—"
Azael sighed, the sound heavy with dramatic suffering. Her sunglasses slid down as she looked at the bartender, expression pained. "She's terrible at monogamy. I should've known."
"I'm not!" Heat flooded Seraphine's face, crawling down her neck. "Stop putting words in my mouth!"
"So was I just a fling to you?" Azael pressed a hand to her chest, wounded. "After everything we've shared? The Child Eater, the fae, all those vegetables we've chopped side by side?"
The old ladies dissolved into laughter, not even pretending to work anymore.
Seraphine's knife trembled in her grip. "You are such a jerk."
Azael's smirk softened. She pursed her lips, blowing an exaggerated kiss across the cutting board. "You're adorable when you blush. I forgive you—just this once."
The bartender opened her mouth, clearly trying to salvage the conversation. "I didn't mean to interrupt—"
But Seraphine's attention had locked onto Azael with laser focus, golden eyes narrowing. "You're enjoying this way too much."
"Am I?" Azael returned to her carrots, humming innocently. "I'm just expressing my heartbreak at your wandering eye."
"My eye isn't wandering!"
"Then why is she here flattering you?" Azael gestured with her knife, casual. "Clearly trying to steal you away with compliments and refreshments. Classic seduction technique."
The bartender's face reddened. "That's not—I was just being nice—"
"See? Even she admits it." Azael nodded sagely. "A confession."
Marta wiped her eyes, shoulders shaking. "Oh, this is better than the market drama last week."
Agnes agreed vigorously. "Much better. That was just the butcher's wife throwing produce."
Seraphine grabbed her cup from the tray, taking a long drink to hide her burning face. The liquid did nothing to cool the heat. "Can we please just focus on the vegetables?"
"Changing the subject." Azael tsked. "Avoidance behavior. Classic guilt."
"I'm not guilty because there's nothing to be guilty about!"
The bartender shifted her weight, clearly debating retreat. Her gaze kept flickering between Seraphine and Azael, trying to parse the dynamic and failing spectacularly.
Mirtha took pity. "Thank you for the drinks, dear. Very thoughtful."
The dismissal landed gentle but firm.
The bartender nodded, backing toward the tent entrance. "Right. Well. If you need anything else..."
Her eyes found Seraphine one more time—hopeful, questioning. But the hero was still arguing with Azael. 

* * *
The scent of hot broth and fresh bread filled the courtyard as volunteers began ladling portions into outstretched bowls. The line stretched beyond the gates—hollow cheeks, sunken eyes, hands clutching scraps of cloth and makeshift containers.  
Seraphine found Irene standing apart, arms crossed tight against her chest. Frost laced the edges of her sleeves, creeping up her forearms.  
"You're chilling. Literally."  
Irene exhaled, breath misting in the air. "Clara is... exceptional. I've never met someone so selfless. All she cares about is feeding these people."  
Seraphine nodded, watching Clara move down the line, adjusting portions with quiet precision. "She is."  
A muscle twitched in Irene's jaw. "Yet why are they all starving? There are animals in the woods. There should be jobs. What are their governors doing?"  
Seraphine caught the way Irene's teeth dug into her lower lip—a rare crack in her composure. Her gaze drifted over the crowd, landing on Azael, who shouldered past the other cooks to serve despite being dismissed. Further off, Anathema stood motionless as children clambered over his bark-like arms, their laughter sharp against the quiet desperation.  
"I think..." Seraphine hesitated. "We were wrong."  
Irene didn't answer. Just nodded once, sharp, as the frost spread to her collarbone.  
Near the serving table, a child tugged at Azael's sleeve. She handed them an extra roll without breaking stride, her sunglasses hiding where she looked—but Seraphine knew. Knew the exact angle of her chin when she was counting heads, measuring hunger against dwindling supplies.  
Anathema shifted, roots creaking as he bent to let a small girl perch on his shoulder. His empty sockets turned toward Azael, then Irene, then the line snaking into the distance.  
No one spoke. The truth hung heavier than the steam rising from the pots.
