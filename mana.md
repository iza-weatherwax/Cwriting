# MANA

## Definition
Universal energy source. Mana fluctuation is dynamic — it runs low during regular tasks and peaks during combat.

## Regeneration
Fast recharge in small quantities through:
- Rest
- Food
- Potions

## Depletion
Overuse of mana prevents the casting of high-tier spells until the mana threshold is restored.

## Tactical Priority
Mana management is crucial for long-term survival.
