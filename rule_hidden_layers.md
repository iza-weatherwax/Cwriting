# Writing Rule: Hidden Layers

## Principle
Information tagged as **HIDDEN_LAYERS** must **never** be stated explicitly in the text.

## How to Convey It
Use the **Iceberg Theory**: the truth exists beneath the surface, never named directly. Convey hidden layers through:
- Sensory details
- Involuntary physical reactions
- Environmental shifts
- Subtext in dialogue
- What characters *don't* say or do

## Characters with Hidden Layers
- **Azael:** Past trauma and true motivation (waiting for the Goddess)
- **Anathema:** True nature as an Elemental; soul-bond with Azael
- **Selene:** The sacrifice she made to protect Irene
- **Rei:** Dormant Heroic Magic awakening
