# EVENT INDEX — *Zone of Comfort*

## CHAPTER 1 — Part I: Festival & introduction

**Characters + Action:** Azael + Anathema carry Bia and Tomé home after humiliation at festival → deliver Bia to Elena; Tomé processes vicarious grief.
**Revelation/Setup:** Azael has been *pretending* to be human for years; Anathema is recognized as a Doll, which draws less suspicion than the truth.
**Space shift:** Festival streets → Bia's house → Mirtha's bakery.
**Emotional shift:** Bia (broken → comforted); Tomé (confused by own empathy); Azael (exhausted, melancholic).
**Open thread:** Why are Azael's nightmares and headaches worsening? What happened to the Goddess?

---

## CHAPTER 1 — Part II: Guild & reclassification

**Characters + Action:** Marvenna informs Azael about new guildmaster (Irene) and mandatory reclassification exam → Azael takes the screaming pumpkin quest + discovers soil contamination.
**Revelation/Setup:** Azael deliberately stays at Level 2 to avoid attention; the beer discount is her "official" reason for staying registered.
**Space shift:** Quest board → farmer's field → tower/apartment.
**Emotional shift:** Azael (indifferent → mildly worried about the exam); Anathema promises to hold back better.
**Open thread:** The new exam could expose Anathema and Azael. Anathema says he'll "hold back" — but for how long?

---

## CHAPTER 1 — Part III: Seraphine observes the exam

**Characters + Action:** Seraphine monitors Azael at the exam → notices perfectly constant mana + Anathema waves independently → calls Sora → reports to Irene; Marvenna says she'd choose Azael to protect anyone she loves.
**Revelation/Setup:** Azael's mana is a *literal flat line* — impossible with an active Doll. Irene opens an investigation.
**Space shift:** Level 1 arenas → Irene's report room.
**Emotional shift:** Seraphine (curious → determined to investigate); Irene (neutral → intrigued).
**Open thread:** Rei already knew something about Azael. What did Rei see that no one else did?

---

## CHAPTER 2 — Part I: The smell & Bia's disappearance

**Characters + Action:** Azael tracks rot smell for 3 days with no result; carves protective sigils around the bakery → Bia vanishes from her bedroom (which smelled sweet, not rotten).
**Revelation/Setup:** Tomé perceives the smell as *sweet* (honey cakes) rather than rot — his perception cuts through the Child Eater's illusion.
**Space shift:** Streets → bakery → Bia's room → alley / enchanted wall.
**Emotional shift:** Azael (vigilant → cold/determined); Elena (desperate); Tomé (frightened → essential guide).
**Open thread:** The Child Eater has been active longer than the guild realized. "Runaway" children also went missing without official reports.

---

## CHAPTER 2 — Part II: The nest & the battle

**Characters + Action:** Group enters the den (fae glamour); finds Irene's team trapped + Specialists Val and Ananas rendered useless; Azael uses invisible threads to cut creatures + form a platform; Seraphine + Anathema fight the Child Eater in perfect sync → Seraphine decapitates the creature.
**Revelation/Setup:** Azael operates throughout the entire battle with **zero mana fluctuation**. Seraphine lands on an invisible platform after her final leap.
**Space shift:** Child Eater's glamour → real cave with cocoons → guild hall.
**Emotional shift:** Seraphine (professional → disturbed/fascinated); Ananas/Val (arrogant → exposed as incompetent).
**Open thread:** Azael demonstrated her abilities in front of witnesses. Invisibility compromised. Irene will ask questions.

---

## CHAPTER 2 — Part III: Guild reckoning & bakery aftermath

**Characters + Action:** Irene confronts Specialists → suspends both; Marvenna presents Rei's journal with 23+ displaced Level-1 assets; Irene reads and acknowledges systemic failure → intends to speak with Rei upon her return.
**Revelation/Setup:** Clara couldn't report missing children because she lost her Level-1 classification under the new rules → bureaucracy directly caused the disaster.
**Space shift:** Guild hall → Mirtha's bakery.
**Emotional shift:** Irene (serene → embarrassed/determined); Seraphine (already convinced Azael is hiding something).
**Open thread:** Rei was ignored by the capital for years. When she returns, there will be a reckoning.

*(Bakery: kids tease Azael for "having eyes only for the hero" → Azael denies it badly.)*

---

## CHAPTER 3 — Recruitment & departure to the Red Forest

**Characters + Action:** Seraphine picks the missing caravan quest in the Red Forest → goes to the bakery to recruit Azael → flirtation begins; they recruit Damian and Ann at the cottage.
**Revelation/Setup:** Ann is hostile toward Seraphine out of resentment toward the guild (her mother recently died; Damian and Ann lost board access). Damian agrees to prove Rei was right.
**Space shift:** Guild → bakery → Damian's cottage → Red Forest entrance.
**Emotional shift:** Seraphine (investigative → frustrated by her own guilt); Ann (furious → minimally contained); Azael (reluctant → joins with irony).
**Open thread:** Seraphine admits aloud "we broke something that was working." She still doesn't know the full extent of the damage.

---

## CHAPTER 4 — Red Forest & the Fae

**Characters + Action:** Group camps at the edge; Seraphine questions Azael about mana/Anathema → Azael gives a partial explanation ("gift from the woman who raised me," "beloved by a goddess") wrapped in jokes. They enter the forest → Azael sings to lure fae → fae flee from Seraphine in terror, hissing *"Caillech."*
**Revelation/Setup:** The caravan has been dead for days (claw/fang wounds, not fae glamour). The fae *didn't kill anyone* — they only collected corpses. Something else is in the region. The fae recognize something in Seraphine that makes her untouchable.
**Space shift:** Forest edge → campsite → fae clearing → exterior with recovered bodies.
**Emotional shift:** Seraphine (curious → growing alarm); Azael (outwardly calm → internally worried about exposure).
**Open thread:** What is *Caillech*? What did the fae see in Seraphine? Who — or what — killed the caravan before the fae arrived?

---

## CHAPTER 5 — Nightly debrief & Clara's soup kitchen

**Characters + Action:** Azael and Anathema debrief: she admits she "messed up" by singing, plans to be "more normal"; flashback — the Goddess used golden fire to scatter fae when Azael was a child. Next day: Clara's community kitchen → old ladies seat Seraphine beside Azael to chop vegetables → escalating flirtation + Azael's performative jealousy over the bartender.
**Revelation/Setup:** Azael's Goddess literally *burned fae* that approached her. The fae don't fear Seraphine herself — they fear what they recognize in her divine hero's aura. Azael is concealing a supernatural/divine origin.
**Space shift:** Azael's room (night) → church courtyard (day).
**Emotional shift:** Azael (worried about exposure → warmed by familiar routine); Seraphine (suspicious → emotionally confused by Azael); Irene (composed → visibly shaken watching the hunger line).
**Open thread:** Irene and Seraphine both admit "we were wrong" watching Clara serve the poor. Policy shift imminent. Azael plans to fabricate mundane secrets as a distraction — but Anathema knows it won't work.

---

## CHAPTER 6 — Rei returns & Irene yields

**Characters + Action:** Rei arrives furious with yet another denied petition → Irene steps forward, **says she agrees with her** and asks for her help → Rei breaks down after years of shouting into the void and finally hitting something solid.
**Revelation/Setup:** Rei's messages never actually reached Irene (bureaucratic blockage). Irene was genuinely unaware — which is more devastating than deliberate malice.
**Space shift:** Guild hall.
**Emotional shift:** Rei (exploding rage → tearful relief after years of being ignored); Irene (serene → public admission of failure, genuine humility); Seraphine (witness, completing her arc of acknowledged guilt).
**Open thread:** What happens to Rei's 23 Level-1 assets? Will the investigation into Azael pause or accelerate now that Irene wants to rebuild the network? And what — or who — killed the caravan in the Red Forest?
